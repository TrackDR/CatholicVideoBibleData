Job Chapter 35

Eliu declares that the good or evil done by man cannot reach God.

35:1. Moreover Eliu spoke these words:

35:2. Doth thy thought seem right to thee, that thou shouldst say: I am more just than God?

35:3. For thou saidst: That which is right doth not please thee: or what will it profit thee if I sin?

35:4. Therefore I will answer thy words, and thy friends with thee.

35:5. Look up to heaven and see, and behold the sky, that it is higher than thee.

35:6. If thou sin, what shalt thou hurt him? and if thy iniquities be multiplied, what shalt thou do against him?

35:7. And if thou do justly, what shalt thou give him, or what shall he receive of thy hand?

35:8. Thy wickedness may hurt a man that is like thee: and thy justice may help the son of man.

35:9. By reason of the multitude of oppressors they shall cry out: and shall wail for the violence of the arm of tyrants.

35:10. And he hath not said: Where is God, who made me, who hath given songs in the night?

35:11. Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and instructeth us more than the fowls of the air.

35:12. There shall they cry, and he will not hear, because of the pride of evil men.

35:13. God therefore will not hear in vain, and the Almighty will look into the causes of every one.

35:14. Yea, when thou shalt say: He considereth not: be judged before him, and expect him.

35:15. For he doth not now bring on his fury, neither doth he revenge wickedness exceedingly.

35:16. Therefore Job openeth his mouth in vain, and multiplieth words without knowledge.
