Ecclesiasticus Chapter 15

Wisdom embraceth them that fear God. God is not the author of sin.

15:1. He that feareth God, will do good: and he that possesseth justice, shall lay hold on her,

15:2. And she will meet him as an honourable mother, and will receive him as a wife married of a virgin.

15:3. With the bread of life and understanding, she shall feed him, and give him the water of wholesome wisdom to drink: and she shall be made strong in him, and he shall not be moved.

15:4. And she shall hold him fast, and he shall not be confounded: and she shall exalt him among his neighbours.

15:5. And in the midst of the church she shall open his mouth, and shall fill him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding, and shall clothe him with a robe of glory.

15:6. She shall heap upon him a treasure of joy and gladness, and shall cause him to inherit an everlasting name.

15:7. But foolish men shall not obtain her, and wise men shall meet her, foolish men shall not see her: for she is far from pride and deceit.

15:8. Lying men shall be mindful of her: but men that speak truth shall be found with her, and shall advance, even till they come to the sight of God.

15:9. Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner:

15:10. For wisdom came forth from God: for praise shall be with the wisdom of God, and shall abound in a faithful mouth, and the sovereign Lord will give praise unto it.

15:11. Say not: It is through God, that she is not with me: for do not thou the things that he hateth.

15:12. Say not: He hath caused me to err: for he hath no need of wicked men.

15:13. The Lord hateth all abomination of error, and they that fear him shall not love it.

15:14. God made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his own counsel.

15:15. He added his commandments and precepts.

15:16. If thou wilt keep the commandments and perform acceptable fidelity for ever, they shall preserve thee.

15:17. He hath set water and fire before thee: stretch forth thy hand to which thou wilt.

15:18. Before man is life and death, good and evil, that which he shall choose shall be given him:

15:19. For the wisdom of God is great, and he is strong in power, seeing all men without ceasing.

15:20. The eyes of the Lord are towards them that fear him, and he knoweth al the work of man.

15:21. He hath commanded no man to do wickedly, and he hath given no man license to sin;

15:22. For he desireth not a multitude of faithless and unprofitable children.
