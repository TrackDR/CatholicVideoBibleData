Ecclesiasticus Chapter 25

Documents of wisdom on several subjects.

25:1. With three things my spirit is pleased, which are approved before God and men:

25:2. The concord of brethren, and the love of neighbours, and man and wife that agree well together.

25:3. Three sorts my soul hateth, and I am greatly grieved at their life:

25:4. A poor man that is proud: a rich man that is a liar: an old man that is a fool, and doting.

25:5. The things that thou hast not gathered in thy youth, how shalt thou find them in thy old age?

25:6. O how comely is judgment for a grey head, and for ancients to know counsel!

25:7. O how comely is wisdom for the aged, and understanding and counsel to men of honour!

25:8. Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory.

25:9. Nine things that are not to be imagined by the heart have I magnified, and the tenth I will utter to men with my tongue.

25:10. A man that hath joy of his children: and he that liveth and seeth the fall of his enemies.

25:11. Blessed is he that dwelleth with a wise woman, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served such as are unworthy of him.

25:12. Blessed is he that findeth a true friend, and that declareth justice to an ear that heareth.

25:13. How great is he that findeth wisdom and knowledge! but there is none above him that feareth the Lord.

25:14. The fear of God hath set itself above all things:

25:15. Blessed is the man, to whom it is given to have the fear of God: he that holdeth it, to whom shall he be likened?

25:16. The fear of God is the beginning of his love: and the beginning of faith is to be fast joined unto it.

25:17. The sadness of the heart is every plague: and the wickedness of a woman is all evil.

25:18. And a man will choose any plague, but the plague of the heart:

25:19. And any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman:

25:20. And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate him:

25:21. And any revenge, but the revenge of enemies.

25:22. There is no head worse than the head of a serpent:

25:23. And there is no anger above the anger of a woman. It will be more agreeable to abide with a lion and a dragon, than to dwell with a wicked woman.

25:24. The wickedness of a woman changeth her face: and she darkeneth her countenance as a bear: and sheweth it like sackcloth. In the midst of her neighbours,

25:25. Her husband groaned, and hearing he sighed a little.

25:26. All malice is short to the malice of a woman, let the lot of sinners fall upon her.

25:27. As the climbing of a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of tongue to a quiet man.

25:28. Look not upon a woman's beauty, and desire not a woman for beauty.

25:29. A woman's anger, and impudence, and confusion is great.

25:30. A woman, if she have superiority, is contrary to her husband.

25:31. A wicked woman abateth the courage, and maketh a heavy countenance, and a wounded heart.

25:32. Feeble hands, and disjointed knees, a woman that doth not make her husband happy.

25:33. From the woman came the beginning of sin, and by her we all die.

25:34. Give no issue to thy water, no, not a little: nor to a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad.

25:35. If she walk not at thy hand, she will confound thee in the sight of thy enemies.

25:36. Cut her off from thy flesh, lest she always abuse thee.
