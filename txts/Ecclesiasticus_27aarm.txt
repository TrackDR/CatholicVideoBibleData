Ecclesiasticus Chapter 27

Dangers of sin from several heads: the fear of God is the best preservative. He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it.

27:1. Through poverty many have sinned: and he that seeketh to be enriched, turneth away his eye.

27:2. As a stake sticketh fast in the midst of the joining of stones, so also in the midst of selling and buying, sin shall stick fast.

27:3. Sin shall be destroyed with the sinner.

27:4. Unless thou hold thyself diligently in the fear of the Lord, thy house shall quickly be overthrown.

27:5. As when one sifteth with a sieve, the dust will remain: so will the perplexity of a man in his thoughts.

27:6. The furnace trieth the potter's vessels, and the trial of affliction just men.

27:7. As the dressing of a tree sheweth the fruit thereof, so a word out of the thought of the heart of man.

27:8. Praise not a man before he speaketh, for this is the trial of men.

27:9. If thou followest justice, thou shalt obtain her: and shalt put her on as a long robe of honour, and thou shalt dwell with her: and she shall protect thee for ever, and in the day of acknowledgment thou shalt find a strong foundation.

27:10. Birds resort unto their like: so truth will return to them that practise her.

27:11. The lion always lieth in wait for prey: so do sins for them that work iniquities.

27:12. A holy man continueth in wisdom as the sun: but a fool is changed as the moon.

27:13. In the midst of the unwise keep in the word till its time: but be continually among men that think.

27:14. The discourse of sinners is hateful, and their laughter is at the pleasures of sin.

27:15. The speech that sweareth much shall make the hair of the head stand upright: and its irreverence shall make one stop his ears.

27:16. In the quarrels of the road is the shedding of blood: and their cursing is a grievous hearing.

27:17. He that discloseth the secret of a friend loseth his credit, and shall never find a friend to his mind.

27:18. Love thy neighbour, and be joined to him with fidelity.

27:19. But if thou discover his secrets, follow no more after him.

27:20. For as a man that destroyeth his friend, so is he that destroyeth the friendship of his neighbour.

27:21. And as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbour go, and thou shalt not get him again.

27:22. Follow after him no more, for he is gone afar off, he is fled, as a roe escaped out of the snare because his soul is wounded.

27:23. Thou canst no more bind him up. And of a curse there is reconciliation:

27:24. But to disclose the secrets of a friend, leaveth no hope to an unhappy soul.

27:25. He that winketh with the eye forgeth wicked things, and no man will cast him off:

27:26. In the sight of thy eyes he will sweeten his mouth, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and on thy words he will lay a stumblingblock.

27:27. I have hated many things but not like him, and the Lord will hate him.

27:28. If one cast a stone on high, it will fall upon his own head: and the deceitful stroke will wound the deceitful.

27:29. He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that setteth a stone for his neighbour, shall stumble upon it: and he that layeth a snare for another, shall perish in it.

27:30. A mischievous counsel shall be rolled back upon the author, and he shall not know from whence it cometh to him.

27:31. Mockery and reproach are of the proud, and vengeance as a lion shall lie in wait for him.

27:32. They shall perish in a snare that are delighted with the fall of the just: and sorrow shall consume them before they die.

27:33. Anger and fury are both of them abominable, and the sinful man shall be subject to them.
