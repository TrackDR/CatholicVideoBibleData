Hebrews Chapter 5

The office of a high priest. Christ is our high priest.

5:1. For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in the things that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and sacrifices for sins:

5:2. Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he himself also is compassed with infirmity.

5:3. And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.

5:4. Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was.

5:5. So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a high priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son: this day have I begotten thee.

5:6. As he saith also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.

5:7. Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death, was heard for his reverence.

5:8. And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things which he suffered.

5:9. And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause of eternal salvation:

5:10. Called by God a high priest, according to the order of Melchisedech.

5:11. Of whom we have much to say and hard to be intelligibly uttered: because you are become weak to hear.

5:12. For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God: and you are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat.

5:13. For every one that is a partaker of milk is unskilful in the word of justice: for he is a little child.

5:14. But strong meat is for the perfect: for them who by custom have their senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil.
