Romans Chapter 14

The strong must bear with the weak. Cautions against judging and giving scandal.

14:1. Now him that is weak in faith, take unto you: not in disputes about thoughts.

14:2. For one believeth that he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat herbs.

14:3. Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him.

14:4. Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? To his own lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand.

14:5. For one judgeth between day and day: and another judgeth every day. Let every man abound in his own sense.

14:6. He that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that eateth eateth to the Lord: for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not and giveth thanks to God.

14:7. For none of us liveth to himself: and no man dieth to himself.

14:8. For whether we live, we live unto the Lord: or whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's.

14:9. For to this end Christ died and rose again: that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.

14:10. But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? Or thou, why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

14:11. For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God.

14:12. Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for himself.

14:13. Let us not therefore judge one another any more. But judge this rather, that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brother's way.

14:14. I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.

14:15. For if, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now according to charity. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.

14:16. Let not then our good be evil spoken of.

14:17. For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink: but justice and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.

14:18. For he that in this serveth Christ pleaseth God and is approved of men.

14:19. Therefore, let us follow after the things that are of peace and keep the things that are of edification, one towards another.

14:20. Destroy not the work of God for meat. All things indeed are clean: but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.

14:21. It is good not to eat flesh and not to drink wine: nor any thing whereby thy brother is offended or scandalized or made weak.

14:22. Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Blessed is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth.

14:23. But he that discerneth, if he eat, is condemned; because not of faith. For all that is not of faith is sin.
