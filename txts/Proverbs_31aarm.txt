Proverbs Chapter 31

An exhortation to chastity, temperance, and works of mercy; with the praise of a wise woman.

31:1. The words of king Lamuel. The vision wherewith his mother instructed him.

31:2. What, O my beloved, what, O the beloved of my womb, what, O the beloved of my vows?

31:3. Give not thy substance to women, and thy riches to destroy kings.

31:4. Give not to kings, O Lamuel, give not wine to kings: because there is no secret where drunkenness reigneth:

31:5. And lest they drink and forget judgments, and pervert the cause of the children of the poor.

31:6. Give strong drink to them that are sad; and wine to them that are grieved in mind:

31:7. Let them drink, and forget their want, and remember their sorrow no more.

31:8. Open thy mouth for the dumb, and for the causes of all the children that pass.

31:9. Open thy mouth, decree that which is just, and do justice to the needy and poor.

31:10. Who shall find a valiant woman? far, and from the uttermost coasts is the price of her.

31:11. The heart of her husband trusteth in her, and he shall have no need of spoils.

31:12. She will render him good, and not evil all the days of her life.

31:13. She hath sought wool and flax, and hath wrought by the counsel of her hands.

31:14. She is like the merchant's ship, she bringeth her bread from afar.

31:15. And she hath risen in the night, and given a prey to her household, and victuals to her maidens.

31:16. She hath considered a field, and bought it: with the fruit of her hands she hath planted a vineyard.

31:17. She hath girded her loins with strength, and hath strengthened her arm.

31:18. She hath tasted, and seen that her traffic is good: her lamp shall not be put out in the night.

31:19. She hath put out her hand to strong things, and her fingers have taken hold of the spindle.

31:20. She hath opened her hand to the needy, and stretched out her hands to the poor.

31:21. She shall not fear for her house in the cold of snow: for all her domestics are clothed with double garments.

31:22. She hath made for herself clothing of tapestry: fine linen, and purple, is her covering.

31:23. Her husband is honourable in the gates, when he sitteth among the senators of the land.

31:24. She made fine linen, and sold it, and delivered a girdle to the Chanaanite.

31:25. Strength and beauty are her clothing, and she shall laugh in the latter day.

31:26. She hath opened her mouth to wisdom, and the law of clemency is on her tongue.

31:27. She hath looked well on the paths of her house, and hath not eaten her bread idle.

31:28. Her children rose up, and called her blessed: her husband, and he praised her.

31:29. Many daughters have gathered together riches: thou hast surpassed them all.

31:30. Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: the woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.

31:31. Give her of the fruit of her hands: and let her works praise her in the gates.
