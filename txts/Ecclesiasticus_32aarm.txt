Ecclesiasticus Chapter 32

Lessons for superiors and inferiors. Advantages of fearing God, and doing nothing without counsel.

32:1. Have they made thee ruler? be not lifted up: be among them as one of them.

32:2. Have care of them, and so sit down, and when thou hast acquitted thyself of all thy charge, take thy place:

32:3. That thou mayst rejoice for them, and receive a crown as an ornament of grace, and get the honour of the contribution.

32:4. Speak, thou that art elder: for it becometh thee,

32:5. To speak the first word with careful knowledge, and hinder not music.

32:6. Where there is no hearing, pour not out words, and be not lifted up out of season with thy wisdom.

32:7. A concert of music in a banquet of wine is as a carbuncle set in gold.

32:8. As a signet of an emerald in a work of gold: so is the melody of music with pleasant and moderate wine.

32:9. Hear in silence, and for thy reverence good grace shall come to thee.

32:10. Young man, scarcely speak in thy own cause.

32:11. If thou be asked twice, let thy answer be short.

32:12. In many things be as if thou wert ignorant, and hear in silence and withal seeking.

32:13. In the company of great men take not upon thee: and when the ancients are present, speak not much.

32:14. Before a storm goeth lightning: and before shamefacedness goeth favour: and for thy reverence good grace shall come to thee.

32:15. And at the time of rising be not slack: but be first to run home to thy house, and there withdraw thyself, and there take thy pastime.

32:16. And do what thou hast a mind, but not in sin or proud speech.

32:17. And for all these things bless the Lord, that made thee, and that replenisheth thee with all his good things.

32:18. He that feareth the Lord, will receive his discipline: and they that will seek him early, shall find a blessing.

32:19. He that seeketh the law, shall be filled with it: and he that dealeth deceitfully, shall meet with a stumblingblock therein.

32:20. They that fear the Lord, shall find just judgment, and shall kindle justice as a light.

32:21. A sinful man will flee reproof, and will find an excuse according to his will.

32:22. A man of counsel will not neglect understanding, a strange and proud man will not dread fear:

32:23. Even after he hath done with fear without counsel, he shall be controlled by the things of his own seeking.

32:24. My son, do thou nothing without counsel, and thou shalt not repent when thou hast done.

32:25. Go not in the way of ruin, and thou shalt not stumble against the stones: trust not thyself to a rugged way, lest thou set a stumblingblock to thy soul.

32:26. And beware of thy own children, and take heed of them of thy household.

32:27. In every work of thine regard thy soul in faith: for this is the keeping of the commandments.
