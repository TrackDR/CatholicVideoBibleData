Exodus Chapter 40

The tabernacle is commanded to be set up and anointed. God filleth it with his majesty.

40:1. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

40:2. The first month, the first day of the month, thou shalt set up the tabernacle of the testimony,

40:3. And shalt put the ark in it, and shalt let down the veil before it:

40:4. And thou shalt bring in the table, and set upon it the things that are commanded according to the rite.  The candlestick shall stand with its lamps,

40:5. And the altar of gold, whereon the incense is burnt before the ark of the testimony. Thou shalt put the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle,

40:6. And before it the altar of holocaust.

40:7. The laver between the altar and the tabernacle, and thou shalt fill it with water.

40:8. And thou shalt encompass the court with hangings, and the entry thereof.

40:9. And thou shalt take the oil of unction and anoint the tabernacle with its vessels, that they may be sanctified:

40:10. The altar of holocaust and all its vessels:

40:11. The laver with its foot: thou shalt consecrate all with the oil of unction, that they may be most holy.

40:12. And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and having washed them with water,

40:13. Thou shalt put on them the holy vestments, that they may minister to me, and that the unction of them may prosper to an everlasting priesthood.

40:14. And Moses did all that the Lord had commanded.

40:15. So in the first month of the second year, the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.

40:16. And Moses reared it up, and placed the boards and the sockets and the bars, and set up the pillars,

40:17. And spread the roof over the tabernacle, putting over it a cover, as the Lord had commanded.

40:18. And he put the testimony in the ark, thrusting bars underneath, and the oracle above.

40:19. And when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle, he drew the veil before it to fulfill the commandment of the Lord.

40:20. And he set the table in the tabernacle of the testimony, at the north side, without the veil,

40:21. Setting there in order the loaves of proposition, as the Lord had commanded Moses.

40:22. He set the candlestick also in the tabernacle of the testimony, over against the table on the south side,

40:23. Placing the lamps in order, according to the precept of the Lord.

40:24. He set also the altar of gold under the roof of the testimony, over against the veil,

40:25. And burnt upon it the incense of spices, as the Lord had commanded Moses.

40:26. And he put also the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony,

40:27. And the altar of holocaust in the entry of the testimony, offering the holocaust, and the sacrifices upon it, as the Lord had commanded.

40:28. And he set the laver between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar, filling it with water.

40:29. And Moses and Aaron, and his sons, washed their hands and feet,

40:30. When they went into the tabernacle of the covenant, and went to the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses.

40:31. He set up also the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, drawing the hanging in the entry thereof. After all things were perfected,

40:32. The cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony, and the glory of the Lord filled it.

40:33. Neither could Moses go into the tabernacle of the covenant, the cloud covering all things, and the majesty of the Lord shining, for the cloud had covered all.

40:34. If at any time the cloud removed from the tabernacle, the children of Israel went forward by their troops:

40:35. If it hung over, they remained in the same place.

40:36. For the cloud of the Lord hung over the tabernacle by day, and a fire by night, in the sight of all the children of Israel throughout all their mansions.
