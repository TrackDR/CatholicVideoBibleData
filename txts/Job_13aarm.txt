Job Chapter 13

Job persists in maintaining his innocence: and reproves his friends.

13:1. Behold my eye hath seen all these things, and my ear hath heard them, and I have understood them all.

13:2. According to your knowledge I also know: neither am I inferior to you.

13:3. But yet I will speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.

13:4. Having first shewn that you are forgers of lies, and maintainers of perverse opinions.

13:5. And I wish you would hold your peace, that you might be thought to be wise men.

13:6. Hear ye therefore my reproof, and attend to the judgment of my lips.

13:7. Hath God any need of your lie, that you should speak deceitfully for him?

13:8. Do you accept this person, and do you endeavour to judge for God?

13:9. Or shall it please him, from whom nothing can be concealed? or shall he be deceived as a man, with your deceitful dealings?

13:10. He shall reprove you, because in secret you accept his person.

13:11. As soon as he shall move himself, he shall trouble you: and his dread shall fall upon you.

13:12. Your remembrance shall be compared to ashes, and your necks shall be brought to clay.

13:13. Hold your peace a little while, that I may speak whatsoever my mind shall suggest to me.

13:14. Why do I tear my flesh with my teeth, and carry my soul in my hands?

13:15. Although he should kill me, I will trust in him: but yet I will reprove my ways in his sight.

13:16. And he shall be my saviour: for no hypocrite shall come before his presence.

13:17. Hear ye my speech, and receive with your ears hidden truths.

13:18. If I shall be judged, I know that I shall be found just.

13:19. Who is he that will plead against me? let him come: why am I consumed holding my peace?

13:20. Two things only do not to me, and then from thy face I shall not be hid:

13:21. Withdraw thy hand far from me, and let not thy dread terrify me.

13:22. Call me, and I will answer thee: or else I will speak, and do thou answer me.

13:23. How many are my iniquities and sins? make me know my crimes and offenses.

13:24. Why hidest thou thy face, and thinkest me thy enemy?

13:25. Against a leaf, that is carried away with the wind, thou shewest thy power, and thou pursuest a dry straw.

13:26. For thou writest bitter things against me, and wilt consume me for the sins of my youth.

13:27. Thou hast put my feet in the stocks, and hast observed all my paths, and hast considered the steps of my feet:

13:28. Who am to be consumed as rottenness, and as a garment that is motheaten.
