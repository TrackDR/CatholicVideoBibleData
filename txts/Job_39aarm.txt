Job Chapter 39  The wonders of the power and providence of God in many of his creatures.

39:1. Knowest thou the time when the wild goats bring forth among the rocks, or hast thou observed the hinds when they fawn?

39:2. Hast thou numbered the months of their conceiving, or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?

39:3. They bow themselves to bring forth young, and they cast them, and send forth roarings.

39:4. Their young are weaned and go to feed: they go forth, and return not to them.

39:5. Who hath sent out the wild ass free, and who hath loosed his bonds?

39:6. To whom I have given a house in the wilderness, and his dwellings in the barren land.

39:7. He scorneth the multitude of the city, he heareth not the cry of the driver.

39:8. He looketh round about the mountains of his pasture, and seeketh for every green thing,

39:9. Shall the rhinoceros be willing to serve thee, or will he stay at thy crib?

39:10. Canst thou bind the rhinoceros with thy thong to plough, or will he break the clods of the valleys after thee?

39:11. Wilt thou have confidence in his great strength, and leave thy labours to him?

39:12. Wilt thou trust him that he will render thee the seed, and gather it into thy barnfloor?

39:13. The wing of the ostrich is like the wings of the heron, and of the hawk.

39:14. When she leaveth her eggs on the earth, thou perhaps wilt warm them in the dust.

39:15. She forgetteth that the foot may tread upon them, or that the beasts of the field may break them.

39:16. She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers, she hath laboured in vain, no fear constraining her.

39:17. For God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he given her understanding.

39:18. When time shall be, she setteth up her wings on high: she scorneth the horse and his rider.

39:19. Wilt thou give strength to the horse or clothe his neck with neighing?

39:20. Wilt thou lift him up like the locusts? the glory of his nostrils is terror.

39:21. He breaketh up the earth with his hoof, he pranceth boldly, he goeth forward to meet armed men.

39:22. He despiseth fear, he turneth not his back to the sword.

39:23. Above him shall the quiver rattle, the spear and shield shall glitter.

39:24. Chasing and raging he swalloweth the ground, neither doth he make account when the noise of the trumpet soundeth.

39:25. When he heareth the trumpet he saith: Ha, ha: he smelleth the battle afar off, the encouraging of the captains, and the shouting of the army.

39:26. Doth the hawk wax feathered by thy wisdom, spreading her wings to the south?

39:27. Will the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest in high places?

39:28. She abideth among the rocks, and dwelleth among cragged flints, and stony hills, where there is no access.

39:29. From thence she looketh for the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.

39:30. Her young ones shall suck up blood: and wheresoever the carcass shall be, she is immediately there.

39:31. And the Lord went on, and said to Job:

39:32. Shall he that contendeth with God be so easily silenced?  surely he that reproveth God, ought to answer him.

39:33. Then Job answered the Lord, and said:

39:34. What can I answer, who hath spoken inconsiderately? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.

39:35. One thing I have spoken, which I wish I had not said: and another, to which I will add no more.
