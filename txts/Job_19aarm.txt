Job Chapter 19

Job complains of the cruelty of his friends; he describes his own sufferings: and his belief of a future resurrection.

19:1. Then Job answered, and said:

19:2. How long do you afflict my soul, and break me in pieces with words?

19:3. Behold, these ten times you confound me, and are not ashamed to oppress me.

19:4. For if I have been ignorant, my ignorance shall be with me.

19:5. But you set yourselves up against me, and reprove me with my reproaches.

19:6. At least now understand, that God hath not afflicted me with an equal judgment, and compassed me with his scourges.

19:7. Behold I shall cry suffering violence, and no one will hear: I shall cry aloud, and there is none to judge.

19:8. He hath hedged in my path round about, and I cannot pass, and in my way he hath set darkness.

19:9. He hath stripped me of my glory, and hath taken the crown from my head.

19:10. He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am lost, and he hath taken away my hope, as from a tree that is plucked up.

19:11. His wrath is kindled against me, and he hath counted me as his enemy.

19:12. His troops have come together, and have made themselves a way by me, and have besieged my tabernacle round about.

19:13. He hath put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintance like strangers have departed from me.

19:14. My kinsmen have forsaken me, and they that knew me, have forgotten me.

19:15. They that dwell in my house, and my maidservants have counted me as a stranger, and I have been like an alien in their eyes.

19:16. I called my servant, and he gave me no answer, I entreated him with my own mouth.

19:17. My wife hath abhorred my breath, and I entreated the children of my womb.

19:18. Even fools despised me, and when I was gone from them, they spoke against me.

19:19. They that were sometime my counsellors, have abhorred me: and he whom I loved most is turned against me.

19:20. The flesh being consumed, my bone hath cleaved to my skin, and nothing but lips are left about my teeth.

19:21. Have pity on me, have pity on me, at least you my friends, because the hand of the Lord hath touched me.

19:22. Why do you persecute me as God, and glut yourselves with my flesh?

19:23. Who will grant me that my words may be written? who will grant me that they may be marked down in a book?

19:24. With an iron pen and in a plate of lead, or else be graven with an instrument in flint stone?

19:25. For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and in the last day I shall rise out of the earth.

19:26. And I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh I shall see my God.

19:27. Whom I myself shall see, and my eyes shall behold, and not another: this my hope is laid up in my bosom.

19:28. Why then do you say now: Let us persecute him, and let us find occasion of word against him?

19:29. Flee then from the face of the sword, for the sword is the revenger of iniquities: and know ye that there is a judgment.
