Mark Chapter 14

The first part of the history of the passion of Christ.

14:1. Now the feast of the pasch and of the Azymes was after two days: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hold on him and kill him.

14:2. But they said: Not on the festival day, lest there should be a tumult among the people.

14:3. And when he was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard. And breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head.

14:4. Now there were some that had indignation within themselves and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made?

14:5. For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.

14:6. But Jesus said: Let her alone. Why do You molest her? She hath wrought a good work upon me.

14:7. For the poor you have always with you: and whensoever you will, you may do them good: but me you have not always.

14:8. She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body for the burial.

14:9. Amen, I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done shall be told for a memorial of her.

14:10. And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them.

14:11. Who hearing it were glad: and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.

14:12. Now on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the pasch, the disciples say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go and prepare for thee to eat the pasch?

14:13. And he sendeth two of his disciples and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him.

14:14. And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?

14:15. And he will shew you a large dining room furnished. And there prepare ye for us.

14:16. And his disciples went their way and came into the city.  And they found as he had told them: and they prepared the pasch.

14:17. And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve.

14:18. And when they were at table and eating, Jesus saith: Amen I say to you, one of you that eateth with me shall betray me.

14:19. But they began to be sorrowful and to say to him, one by one: Is it I?

14:20. Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish.

14:21. And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed.  It were better for him, if that man had not been born.

14:22. And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing, broke and gave to them and said: Take ye. This is my body.

14:23. And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank of it.

14:24. And he said to them: This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many.

14:25. Amen I say to you that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.

14:26. And when they had sung an hymn, they went forth to the mount of Olives.

14:27. And Jesus saith to them: You will all be scandalized in my regard this night. For it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed.

14:28. But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

14:29. But Peter saith to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, yet not I.

14:30. And Jesus saith to him: Amen I say to thee, to-day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.

14:31. But he spoke the more vehemently: Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.

14:32. And they came to a farm called Gethsemani. And he saith to his disciples: Sit you here, while I pray.

14:33. And he taketh Peter and James and John with him: and he began to fear and to be heavy.

14:34. And he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death.  Stay you here and watch.

14:35. And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground: and he prayed that, if it might be, the hour might pass from him.

14:36. And he saith: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.

14:37. And he cometh and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? Couldst thou not watch one hour?

14:38. Watch ye: and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

14:39. And going away again, he prayed, saying the same words.

14:40. And when he returned, he found them again asleep (for their eyes were heavy): and they knew not what to answer him.

14:41. And he cometh the third time and saith to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest. It is enough. The hour is come: behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.

14:42. Rise up: let us go. Behold, he that will betray me is at hand.

14:43. And while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve: and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients.

14:44. And he that betrayed him had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he. Lay hold on him: and lead him away carefully.

14:45. And when he was come, immediately going up to him he saith: Hail, Rabbi! And he kissed him.

14:46. But they laid hands on him and held him.

14:47. And one of them that stood by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the chief priest and cut off his ear.

14:48. And Jesus answering, said to them: Are you come out as to a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me?

14:49. I was daily with you in the temple teaching: and you did not lay hands on me. But that the scriptures may be fulfilled.

14:50. Then his disciples, leaving him, all fled away.

14:51. And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body. And they laid hold on him.

14:52. But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked.

14:53. And they brought Jesus to the high priest. And all the priests and the scribes and the ancients assembled together.

14:54. And Peter followed him afar off, even into the court of the high priest. And he sat with the servants at the fire and warmed himself.

14:55. And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, that they might put him to death: and found none.

14:56. For many bore false witness against him: and their evidences were not agreeing.

14:57. And some rising up, bore false witness against him, saying:

14:58. We heard him say, I Will destroy this temple made with hands and within three days I will build another not made with hands.

14:59. And their witness did not agree.

14:60. And the high priest rising up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying: Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these men?

14:61. But he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him and said to him: Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed God?

14:62. And Jesus said to him: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God and coming with the clouds of heaven.

14:63. Then the high priest rending his garments, saith: What need we any further witnesses?

14:64. You have heard the blasphemy. What think you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death.

14:65. And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him: Prophesy. And the servants struck him with the palms their hands.

14:66. Now when Peter was in the court below, there cometh one of the maidservants of the high priest.

14:67. And when she had seen Peter warming himself looking on him, she saith: Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.

14:68. But he denied, saying: I neither know nor understand what thou sayest. And he went forth before the court; and the cock crew.

14:69. And again a maidservant seeing him, began to say to the standers by: This is one of them.

14:70. But he denied again. And after a, while they that stood by said again to Peter: Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean.

14:71. But he began o curse and to swear, saying: I know not this man of whom you speak.

14:72. And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me. And he began to weep,
