Proverbs Chapter 25

25:1. These are also parables of Solomon, which the men of Ezechias, king of Juda, copied out.

25:2. It is the glory of God to conceal the word, and the glory of kings to search out the speech.

25:3. The heaven above and the earth beneath, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.

25:4. Take away the rust from silver, and there shall come forth a most pure vessel:

25:5. Take away wickedness from the face of the king, and his throne shall be established with justice.

25:6. Appear not glorious before the king, and stand not in the place of great men.

25:7. For it is better that it should be said to thee: Come up hither; than that thou shouldst be humbled before the prince.

25:8. The things which thy eyes have seen, utter not hastily in a quarrel: lest afterward thou mayst not be able to make amends, when thou hast dishonoured thy friend.

25:9. Treat thy cause with thy friend, and discover not the secret to a stranger:

25:10. Lest he insult over thee, when he hath heard it, and cease not to upbraid thee.  Grace and friendship deliver a man: keep these for thyself, lest thou fall under reproach.

25:11. To speak a word in due time, is like apples of gold on beds of silver.

25:12. As an earring of gold and a bright pearl, so is he that reproveth the wise, and the obedient ear.

25:13. As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to him that sent him, for he refresheth his soul.

25:14. As clouds, and wind, when no rain followeth, so is the man that boasteth, and doth not fulfil his promises.

25:15. By patience a prince shall be appeased, and a soft tongue shall break hardness.

25:16. Thou hast found honey, eat what is sufficient for thee, lest being glutted therewith thou vomit it up.

25:17. Withdraw thy foot from the house of thy neighbour, lest having his fill he hate thee.

25:18. A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour, is like a dart and a sword and a sharp arrow.

25:19. To trust in an unfaithful man in the time of trouble, is like a rotten tooth, and weary foot,

25:20. And one that looseth his garment in cold weather. As vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to a very evil heart. As a moth doth by a garment, and a worm by the wood: so the sadness of a man consumeth the heart.

25:21. If thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat: if he thirst, give him water to drink:

25:22. For thou shalt heap hot coals upon his head, and the Lord will reward thee.

25:23. The north wind driveth away rain, as doth a sad countenance a backbiting tongue.

25:24. It is better to sit in a corner of the housetop: than with a brawling woman, and in a common house.

25:25. As cold water to a thirsty soul, so are good tidings from a far country.

25:26. A just man falling down before the wicked, is as a fountain troubled with the foot and a corrupted spring.

25:27. As it is not good for a man to eat much honey, so he that is a searcher of majesty shall be overwhelmed by glory.

25:28. As a city that lieth open and is not compassed with walls, so is a man that cannot refrain his own spirit in speaking.
