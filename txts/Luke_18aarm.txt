Luke Chapter 18

We must pray always. The Pharisee and the publican. The danger of riches. The blind man is restored to sight.

18:1. And he spoke also a parable to them, that we ought always to pray and not to faint,

18:2. Saying: There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God nor regarded man.

18:3. And there was a certain widow in that city; and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary.

18:4. And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God nor regard man,

18:5. Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.

18:6. And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith.

18:7. And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night? And will he have patience in their regard?

18:8. I say to you that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?

18:9. And to some who trusted in themselves as just and despised others, he spoke also this parable:

18:10. Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee and the other a publican.

18:11. The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.

18:12. I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.

18:13. And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O God, be merciful to me a sinner.

18:14. I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather than the other: because every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

18:15. And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.

18:16. But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

18:17. Amen, I say to you: Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child shall not enter into it.

18:18. And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good master, what shall I do to possess everlasting life?

18:19. And Jesus said to him: Why dost thou call me good? None is good but God alone.

18:20. Thou knowest the commandments: Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: Honour thy father and mother.

18:21. Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth.

18:22. Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee. Sell all whatever thou hast and give to the poor: and thou shalt have treasure in heaven. And come, follow me.

18:23. He having heard these things, became sorrowful: for he was very rich.

18:24. And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God:

18:25. For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

18:26. And they that heard it said: Who then can be saved?

18:27. He said to them: The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.

18:28. Then Peter said: Behold, we have left all things and have followed thee.

18:29. Who said to them: Amen, I say to you, there is no man that hath left home or parents or brethren or wife or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,

18:30. Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.

18:31. Then Jesus took unto him the twelve and said to them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man.

18:32. For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles and shall be mocked and scourged and spit upon.

18:33. And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death. And the third day he shall rise again.

18:34. And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them: and they understood not the things that were said.

18:35. Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the way side, begging.

18:36. And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.

18:37. And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.

18:38. And he cried out, saying: Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.

18:39. And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me.

18:40. And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him.  And when he was come near, he asked him,

18:41. Saying; What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see.

18:42. And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.

18:43. And immediately he saw and followed him, glorifying God.  And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
