Hebrews Chapter 8

More of the excellence of the priesthood of Christ and of the New Testament.

8:1. Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens,

8:2. A minister of the holies and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man.

8:3. For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer.

8:4. If then he were on earth, he would not be a priest: seeing that there would be others to offer gifts according to the law.

8:5. Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things. As it was answered to Moses, when he was to finish the tabernacle: See (saith he) that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee on the mount.

8:6. But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also he is a mediator of a better testament which is established on better promises.

8:7. For if that former had been faultless, there should not indeed a place have been sought for a second.

8:8. For, finding fault with them, he saith: Behold the days shall come, saith the Lord: and I will perfect, unto the house of Israel and unto the house of Juda, a new testament:

8:9. Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in my testament: and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.

8:10. For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my laws into their mind: and in their heart will I write them. And I will be their God: and they shall be my people.

8:11. And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying: Know the Lord. For all shall know me, from the least to the greatest of them.

8:12. Because I will be merciful to their iniquities: and their sins I will remember no more.

8:13. Now in saying a new, he hath made the former old. And that which decayeth and groweth old is near its end.
