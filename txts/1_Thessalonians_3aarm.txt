1 Thessalonians Chapter 3

The apostle's concern and love for the Thessalonians.

3:1. For which cause, forbearing no longer, we thought it good to remain at Athens alone.

3:2. And we sent Timothy, our brother and the minister of God in the gospel of Christ, to confirm you and exhort you concerning your faith:

3:3. That no man should be moved in these tribulations: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

3:4. For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we should suffer tribulations: as also it is come to pass, and you know.

3:5. For this cause also, I, forbearing no longer, sent to know your faith: lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you: and our labour should be made vain.

3:6. But now when Timothy came to us from you and related to us your faith and charity, and that you have a good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us as we also to see you:

3:7. Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our necessity and tribulation, by your faith.

3:8. Because now we live, if you stand in the Lord.

3:9. For what thanks can we return to God for you, in all the joy wherewith we rejoice for you before our God,

3:10. Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith?

3:11. Now God himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.

3:12. And may the Lord multiply you and make you abound in charity towards one another and towards all men: as we do also towards you,

3:13. To confirm your hearts without blame, in holiness, before God and our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints. Amen.
