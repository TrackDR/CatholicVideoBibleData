20:6. There is one that holdeth his peace, because he knoweth not what to say: and there is another that holdeth his peace, knowing the proper time.

20:7. A wise man will hold his peace till he see opportunity: but a babbler, and a fool, will regard no time.

20:8. He that useth many words shall hurt his own soul: and he that taketh authority to himself unjustly shall be hated.

20:18. For they that eat his bread, are of a false tongue. How often, and how many will laugh him to scorn!

20:19. For he doth not distribute with right understanding that which was to be had: in like manner also that which was not to be had.

20:20. The slipping of a false tongue is as one that falleth on the pavement: so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily.

20:21. A man without grace is as a vain fable, it shall be continually in the mouth of the unwise.

20:31. Presents and gifts blind the eyes of judges, and make them dumb in the mouth, so that they cannot correct.

20:32. O Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is not seen: what profit is there in them both?

20:33. Better is he that hideth his folly, than the man that hideth his wisdom.
