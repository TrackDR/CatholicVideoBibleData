John Chapter 9

He gives sight to the man born blind.

9:1. And Jesus passing by, saw a man who was blind from his birth.

9:2. And his disciples asked him: Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?

9:3. Jesus answered: Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.

9:4. I must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.

9:5. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

9:6. When he had said these things, he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and spread the clay upon his eyes,

9:7. And said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloe, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore and washed: and he came seeing.

9:8. The neighbours, therefore, and they who had seen him before that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat and begged?  Some said: This is he.

9:9. But others said: No, but he is like him. But he said: I am he.

9:10. They said therefore to him: How were thy eyes opened?

9:11. He answered: That man that is called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloe and wash. And I went: I washed: and I see.

9:12. And they said to him: Where is he? He saith: I know not.

9:13. They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees.

9:14. Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.

9:15. Again therefore the Pharisees asked him how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes: and I washed: and I see.

9:16. Some therefore of the Pharisees said: This man is not of God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.

9:17. They say therefore to the blind man again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened thy eyes? And he said: He is a prophet.

9:18. The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,

9:19. And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see?

9:20. His parents answered them and said: We know that this is our son and that he was born blind:

9:21. But how he now seeth, we know not: or who hath opened his eyes, we know not. Ask himself: he is of age: Let him speak for himself.

9:22. These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.

9:23. Therefore did his parents say: He is of age. Ask himself.

9:24. They therefore called the man again that had been blind and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.

9:25. He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I know not.  One thing I know, that whereas I was blind now I see.

9:26. They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes?

9:27. He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard. Why would you hear it again? Will you also become his disciples?

9:28. They reviled him therefore and said: Be thou his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.

9:29. We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we know not from whence he is.

9:30. The man answered and said to them: why, herein is a wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.

9:31. Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a server of God and doth his, will, him he heareth.

9:32. From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.

9:33. Unless this man were of God, he could not do anything.

9:34. They answered and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins; and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.

9:35. Jesus heard that they had cast him out. And when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son of God?

9:36. He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?

9:37. And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee.

9:38. And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him.

9:39. And Jesus said: For judgment I am come into this world: that they who see not may see; and they who see may become blind.

9:40. And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard: and they said unto him: Are we also blind?

9:41. Jesus said to them: If you were blind, you should not have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth.
