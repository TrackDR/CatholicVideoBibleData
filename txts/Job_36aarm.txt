Job Chapter 36

Eliu proceeds in setting forth the justice and power of God.

36:1. Eliu also proceeded, and said:

36:2. Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee: for I have yet somewhat to speak in God's behalf.

36:3. I will repeat my knowledge from the beginning, and I will prove my Maker just.

36:4. For indeed my words are without a lie, and perfect knowledge shall be proved to thee.

36:5. God doth not cast away the mighty, whereas he himself also is mighty.

36:6. But he saveth not the wicked, and he giveth judgment to the poor.

36:7. He will not take away his eyes from the just, and he placeth kings on the throne for ever, and they are exalted.

36:8. And if they shall be in chains, and be bound with the cords of poverty:

36:9. He shall shew them their works, and their wicked deeds, because they have been violent.

36:10. He also shall open their ear, to correct them: and shall speak, that they may return from iniquity.

36:11. If they shall hear and observe, they shall accomplish their days in good, and their years in glory.

36:12. But if they hear not, they shall pass by the sword, and shall be consumed in folly.

36:13. Dissemblers and crafty men prove the wrath of God, neither shall they cry when they are bound.

36:14. Their soul shall die in a storm, and their life among the effeminate.

36:15. He shall deliver the poor out of his distress, and shall open his ear in affliction.

36:16. Therefore he shall set thee at large out of the narrow mouth, and which hath no foundation under it: and the rest of thy table shall be full of fatness.

36:17. Thy cause hath been judged as that of the wicked, cause and judgment thou shalt recover.

36:18. Therefore let not anger overcome thee to oppress any man: neither let multitude of gifts turn thee aside.

36:19. Lay down thy greatness without tribulation, and all the mighty of strength.

36:20. Prolong not the night that people may come up for them.

36:21. Beware thou turn not aside to iniquity: for this thou hast begun to follow after misery.

36:22. Behold, God is high in his strength, and none is like him among the lawgivers.

36:23. Who can search out his ways? or who can say to him: Thou hast wrought iniquity?

36:24. Remember that thou knowest not his work, concerning which men have sung.

36:25. All men see him, every one beholdeth afar off.

36:26. Behold, God is great, exceeding our knowledge: the number of his years is inestimable.

36:27. He lifteth up the drops of rain, and poureth out showers like floods:

36:28. Which flow from the clouds that cover all above.

36:29. If he will spread out clouds as his tent,

36:30. And lighten with his light from above, he shall cover also the ends of the sea.

36:31. For by these he judgeth people, and giveth food to many mortals.

36:32. In his hands he hideth the light, and commandeth it to come again.

36:33. He sheweth his friend concerning it, that it is his possession, and that he may come up to it.
