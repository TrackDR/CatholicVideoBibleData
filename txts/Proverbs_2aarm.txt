Proverbs Chapter 2

The advantages of wisdom: and the evils from which it delivers.

2:1. My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and wilt hide my commandments with thee,

2:2. That thy ear may hearken to wisdom: incline thy heart to know prudence.

2:3. For if thou shalt call for wisdom, and incline thy heart to prudence:

2:4. If thou shalt seek her as money, and shalt dig for her as for a treasure:

2:5. Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and shalt find the knowledge of God:

2:6. Because the Lord giveth wisdom: and out of his mouth cometh prudence and knowledge.

2:7. He wilt keep the salvation of the righteous, and protect them that walk in simplicity,

2:8. Keeping the paths of justice, and guarding the ways of saints.

2:9. Then shalt thou understand justice, and judgment, and equity, and every good path.

2:10. If wisdom shall enter into thy heart, and knowledge please thy soul:

2:11. Counsel shall keep thee, and prudence shall preserve thee,

2:12. That thou mayst be delivered from the evil way, and from the man that speaketh perverse things:

2:13. Who leave the right way, and walk by dark ways:

2:14. Who are glad when they have done evil, and rejoice in the most wicked things:

2:15. Whose ways are perverse, and their steps infamous.

2:16. That thou mayst be delivered from the strange woman, and from the stranger, who softeneth her words;

2:17. And forsaketh the guide of her youth,

2:18. And hath forgotten the covenant of her God: for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths to hell.

2:19. None that go in unto her, shall return again, neither shall they take hold of the paths of life.

2:20. That thou mayst walk in a good way: and mayst keep the paths of the just.

2:21. For they that are upright, shall dwell in the earth; and the simple shall continue in it.

2:22. But the wicked shall be destroyed from the earth: and they that do unjustly, shall be taken away from it.
