1 Corinthians Chapter 13

Charity is to be preferred before all gifts.

13:1. If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

13:2. And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.

13:3. And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

13:4. Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely, is not puffed up,

13:5. Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh no evil:

13:6. Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth:

13:7. Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.

13:8. Charity never falleth away: whether prophecies shall be made void or tongues shall cease or knowledge shall be destroyed.

13:9. For we know in part: and we prophesy in part.

13:10. But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.

13:11. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But, when I became a man, I put away the things of a child.

13:12. We see now through a glass in a dark manner: but then face to face. Now I know in part: but then I shall know even as I am known.

13:13. And now there remain faith, hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity.
