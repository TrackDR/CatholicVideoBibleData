Job Chapter 26

Job declares his sentiments of the wisdom and power of God.

26:1. Then Job answered, and said:

26:2. Whose helper art thou? is it of him that is weak? and dost thou hold up the arm of him that has no strength?

26:3. To whom hast thou given counsel? perhaps to him that hath no wisdom, and thou hast shewn thy very great prudence.

26:4. Whom hast thou desired to teach? was it not him that made life?

26:5. Behold the giants groan under the waters, and they that dwell with them.

26:6. Hell is naked before him, and there is no covering for destruction.

26:7. He stretched out the north over the empty space, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.

26:8. He bindeth up the waters in his clouds, so that they break not out and fall down together.

26:9. He withholdeth the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud over it.

26:10. He hath set bounds about the waters, till light and darkness come to an end.

26:11. The pillars of heaven tremble, and dread at his beck.

26:12. By his power the seas are suddenly gathered together, and his wisdom has struck the proud one.

26:13. His spirit hath adorned the heavens, and his obstetric hand brought forth the winding serpent.

26:14. Lo, these things are said in part of his ways: and seeing we have heard scarce a little drop of his word, who shall be able to behold the thunder of his greatness?
