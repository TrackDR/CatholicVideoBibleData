Job Chapter 37

Eliu goes on in his discourse, shewing God's wisdom and power, by his wonderful works.

37:1. At this my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its place.

37:2. Hear ye attentively the terror of his voice, and the sound that cometh out of his mouth.

37:3. He beholdeth under all the heavens, and his light is upon the ends of the earth.

37:4. After it a noise shall roar, he shall thunder with the voice of his majesty, and shall not be found out, when his voice shall be heard.

37:5. God shall thunder wonderfully with his voice, he that doth great and unsearchable things.

37:6. He commandeth the snow to go down upon the earth, and the winter rain, and the shower of his strength.

37:7. He sealeth up the hand of all men, that every one may know his works.

37:8. Then the beast shall go into his covert, and shall abide in his den.

37:9. Out of the inner parts shall a tempest come, and cold out of the north.

37:10. When God bloweth there cometh frost, and again the waters are poured out abundantly.

37:11. Corn desireth clouds, and the clouds spread their light:

37:12. Which go round about, whithersoever the will of him that governeth them shall lead them, to whatsoever he shall command them upon the face of the whole earth:

37:13. Whether in one tribe, or in his own land, or in what place soever of his mercy he shall command them to be found.

37:14. Hearken to these things, Job: Stand, and consider the wondrous works of God.

37:15. Dost thou know when God commanded the rains, to shew his light of his clouds?

37:16. Knowest thou the great paths of the clouds, and the perfect knowledges?

37:17. Are not thy garments hot, when the south wind blows upon the earth?

37:18. Thou perhaps hast made the heavens with him, which are most strong, as if they were of molten brass.

37:19. Shew us what we may say to him: or we are wrapped up in darkness.

37:20. Who shall tell him the things I speak? even if a man shall speak, he shall be swallowed up.

37:21. But now they see not the light: the air on a sudden shall be thickened into clouds, and the wind shall pass and drive them away.

37:22. Cold cometh out of the north, and to God praise with fear.

37:23. We cannot find him worthily: he is great in strength, and in judgment, and in justice, and he is ineffable.

37:24. Therefore men shall fear him, and all that seem to themselves to be wise, shall not dare to behold him.
