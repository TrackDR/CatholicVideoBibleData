2 Timothy Chapter 3

The character of heretics of latter days. He exhorts Timothy to constancy. Of the great profit of the knowledge of the scriptures.

3:1. Know also this, that in the last days shall come dangerous times.

3:2. Men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, haughty, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, wicked,

3:3. Without affection, without peace, slanderers, incontinent, unmerciful, without kindness,

3:4. Traitors, stubborn, puffed up, and lovers of pleasure more than of God:

3:5. Having an appearance indeed of godliness but denying the power thereof. Now these avoid.

3:6. For of these sort are they who creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, who are led away with divers desires:

3:7. Ever learning, and never attaining to the knowledge of the truth.

3:8. Now as Jannes and Mambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.

3:9. But they shall proceed no farther: for their folly shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.

3:10. But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,

3:11. Persecutions, afflictions: such as came upon me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra: what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord delivered me.

3:12. And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

3:13. But evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse: erring, and driving into error,

3:14. But continue thou in those things which thou hast learned and which have been committed to thee. Knowing of whom thou hast learned them:

3:15. And because from thy infancy thou hast known the holy scriptures which can instruct thee to salvation by the faith which is in Christ Jesus.

3:16. All scripture, inspired of God, is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice:

3:17. That the man of God may be perfect, furnished to every good work.
