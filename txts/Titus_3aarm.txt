Titus Chapter 3

Other instructions and directions for life and doctrine.

3:1. Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers, to obey at a word, to be ready to every good work.

3:2. To speak evil of no man, not to be litigious but gentle: shewing all mildness towards all men.

3:3. For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.

3:4. But when the goodness and kindness of God our Saviour appeared:

3:5. Not by the works of justice which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of regeneration and renovation of the Holy Ghost.

3:6. Whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour:

3:7. That, being justified by his grace, we may be heirs according to hope of life everlasting.

3:8. It is a faithful saying. And these things I will have thee affirm constantly, that they who believe in God may be careful to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.

3:9. But avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain.

3:10. A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid:

3:11. Knowing that he that is such an one is subverted and sinneth, being condemned by his own judgment.

3:12. When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus, make haste to come unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have determined to winter.

3:13. Send forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollo, with care that nothing be wanting to them.

3:14. And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses: that they be not unfruitful.
