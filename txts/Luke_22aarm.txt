Luke Chapter 22

The treason of Judas. The last supper. The first part of the history of the passion.

22:1. Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the pasch, was at hand.

22:2. And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put Jesus to death: but they feared the people.

22:3. And Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve.

22:4. And he went and discoursed with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might betray him to them.

22:5. And they were glad and covenanted to give him money.

22:6. And he promised. And he sought opportunity to betray him in the absence of the multitude.

22:7. And the day of the unleavened bread came, on which it was necessary that the pasch should be killed.

22:8. And he sent Peter and John, saying: Go, and prepare for us the pasch, that we may eat.

22:9. But they said: Where wilt thou that we prepare?

22:10. And he said to them: Behold, as you go into the city, there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him into the house where he entereth in.

22:11. And you shall say to the goodman of the house: The master saith to thee: Where is the guest chamber, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?

22:12. And he will shew you a large dining room, furnished. And there prepare.

22:13. And they going, found as he had said to them and made ready the pasch.

22:14. And when the hour was come, he sat down: and the twelve apostles with him.

22:15. And he said to them: With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with you, before I suffer.

22:16. For I say to you that from this time I will not eat it, till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

22:17. And having taken the chalice, he gave thanks and said: Take and divide it among you.

22:18. For I say to you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God come.

22:19. And taking bread, he gave thanks and brake and gave to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you. Do this for a commemoration of me.

22:20. In like manner, the chalice also, after he had supped, saying: This is the chalice, the new testament in my blood, which shall be shed for you.

22:21. But yet behold: the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.

22:22. And the Son of man indeed goeth, according to that which is determined: but yet, woe to that man by whom he shall be betrayed.

22:23. And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.

22:24. And there was also a strife amongst them, which of them should seem to be the greater.

22:25. And he said to them: The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that have power over them are called beneficent.

22:26. But you not so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger: and he that is the leader, as he that serveth.

22:27. For which is greater, he that sitteth at table or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you, as he that serveth.

22:28. And you are they who have continued with me in my temptations:

22:29. And I dispose to you, as my Father hath disposed to me, a kingdom;

22:30. That you may eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom: and may sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

22:31. And the Lord said: Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.

22:32. But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren.

22:33. Who said to him: Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison and to death.

22:34. And he said: I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, till thou thrice deniest that thou knowest me. And he said to them:

22:35. When I sent you without purse and scrip and shoes, did you want anything?

22:36. But they said: Nothing. Then said he unto them: But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip: and he that hath not, let him sell his coat and buy a sword.

22:37. For I say to you that this that is written must yet be fulfilled in me. And with the wicked was he reckoned. For the things concerning me have an end.

22:38. But they said: Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to them: It is enough.

22:39. And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the Mount of Olives. And his disciples also followed him.

22:40. And when he was come to the place, he said to them: Pray, lest ye enter into temptation.

22:41. And he was withdrawn away from them a stone's cast. And kneeling down, he prayed.

22:42. Saying: Father, if thou wilt, remove this chalice from me: but yet not my will, but thine be done.

22:43. And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed the longer.

22:44. And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground.

22:45. And when he rose up from prayer and was come to the disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow.

22:46. And he said to them: Why sleep you? Arise: pray: lest you enter into temptation.

22:47. As he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them and drew near to Jesus, for to kiss him.

22:48. And Jesus said to him: Judas, dost thou betray the Son of man with a kiss?

22:49. And they that were about him, seeing what would follow, said to him: Lord, shall we strike with the sword?

22:50. And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.

22:51. But Jesus answering, said: Suffer ye thus far. And when he had touched his ear, he healed him.

22:52. And Jesus said to the chief priests and magistrates of the temple and the ancients, that were come unto him: Are ye come out, as it were against a thief, with swords and clubs?

22:53. When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch forth your hands against me: but this is your hour and the power of darkness.

22:54. And apprehending him, they led him to the high priest's house. But Peter followed afar off.

22:55. And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and were sitting about it, Peter was in the midst of them.

22:56. Whom when a certain servant maid had seen sitting at the light and had earnestly beheld him, she said: This man also was with him.

22:57. But he denied him, saying: Woman, I know him not.

22:58. And after a little while, another seeing him, said: Thou also art one of them. But Peter said: O man, I am not.

22:59. And after the space, as it were of one hour, another certain man affirmed, saying: Of a truth, this man was also with him: for he is also a Galilean.

22:60. And Peter said: Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, as he was yet speaking, the cock crew.

22:61. And the Lord turning looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, as he had said: Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny thrice.

22:62. And Peter going out, wept bitterly.

22:63. And the men that held him mocked him and struck him.

22:64. And they blindfolded him and smote his face. And they asked him saying: Prophesy: Who is it that struck thee?

22:65. And blaspheming, many other things they said against him.

22:66. And as soon as it was day, the ancients of the people and the chief priests and scribes came together. And they brought him into their council saying: If thou be the Christ, tell us.

22:67. And he saith to them: If I shall tell you, you will not believe me.

22:68. And if I shall also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go.

22:69. But hereafter the Son of man shall be sitting on the right hand of the power of God.

22:70. Then said they all: Art thou then the Son of God? Who said: You say that I am.

22:71. And they said: What need we any further testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth.
