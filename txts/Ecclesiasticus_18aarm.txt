Ecclesiasticus Chapter 18

God's works are wonderful: we must serve him, and not our lusts.

18:1. He that liveth for ever created all things together. God only shall be justified, and he remaineth an invincible king for ever.

18:2. Who is able to declare his works?

18:3. For who shall search out his glorious acts?

18:4. And who shall show forth the power of his majesty? or who shall be able to declare his mercy?

18:5. Nothing may be taken away, nor added, neither is it possible to find out the glorious works of God.

18:6. When a man hath done, then shall he begin: and when he leaveth off, he shall be at a loss.

18:7. What is man, and what is his grace? and what is his good, or what is his evil?

18:8. The number of the days of men at the most are a hundred years, as a drop of water of the sea are they esteemed: and as a pebble of the sand, so are a few years compared to eternity.

18:9. Therefore God is patient in them, and poureth forth his mercy upon them.

18:10. He hath seen the presumption of their heart that it is wicked, and hath known their end that it is evil.

18:11. Therefore hath he filled up his mercy in their favour, and hath shewn them the way of justice.

18:12. The compassion of man is toward his neighbour: but the mercy of God is upon all flesh.

18:13. He hath mercy, and teacheth, and correcteth, as a shepherd doth his flock.

18:14. He hath mercy on him that receiveth the discipline of mercy, and that maketh haste in his judgments.

18:15. My son, in thy good deeds, make no complaint, and when thou givest any thing, add not grief by an evil word.

18:16. Shall not the dew assuage the heat? so also the good word is better than the gift.

18:17. Lo, is not a word better than a gift? but both are with a justified man.

18:18. A fool will upbraid bitterly: and a gift of one ill taught consumeth the eyes.

18:19. Before judgment prepare thee justice, and learn before thou speak.

18:20. Before sickness take a medicine, and before judgment examine thyself, and thou shalt find mercy in the sight of God.

18:21. Humble thyself before thou art sick, and in the time of sickness shew thy conversation.

18:22. Let nothing hinder thee from praying always, and be not afraid to be justified even to death: for the reward of God continueth for ever.

18:23. Before prayer prepare thy soul: and be not as a man that tempteth God.

18:24. Remember the wrath that shall be at the last day, and the time of repaying when he shall turn away his face.

18:25. Remember poverty in the time of abundance, and the necessities of poverty in the day of riches.

18:26. From the morning until the evening the time shall be changed, and all these are swift in the eyes of God.

18:27. A wise man will fear in every thing, and in the days of sins will beware of sloth.

18:28. Every man of understanding knoweth wisdom, and will give praise to him that findeth her.

18:29. They that were of good understanding in words, have also done wisely themselves: and have understood truth and justice, and have poured forth proverbs and judgments.

18:30. Go not after thy lusts, but turn away from thy own will.

18:31. If thou give to thy soul her desires, she will make thee a joy to thy enemies.

18:32. Take no pleasure in riotous assemblies, be they ever so small: for their concertation is continual.

18:33. Make not thyself poor by borrowing to contribute to feasts when thou hast nothing in thy purse: for thou shalt be an enemy to thy own life.
