John Chapter 10

Christ is the door and the good shepherd. He and his Father are one.

10:1. Amen, amen, I say to you: He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way, the same is a thief and a robber.

10:2. But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

10:3. To him the porter openeth: and the sheep hear his voice.  And he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out.

10:4. And when he hath let out his own sheep, he goeth before them: and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.

10:5. But a stranger they follow not, but fly from him, because they know not the voice of strangers.

10:6. This proverb Jesus spoke to them. But they understood not what he spoke.

10:7. Jesus therefore said to them again: Amen, amen, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.

10:8. All others, as many as have come, are thieves and robbers: and the sheep heard them not.

10:9. I am the door. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved: and he shall go in and go out, and shall find pastures.

10:10. The thief cometh not, but for to steal and to kill and to destroy. I am come that they may have life and may have it more abundantly.

10:11. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.

10:12. But the hireling and he that is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and flieth: and the wolf casteth and scattereth the sheep,

10:13. And the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling: and he hath no care for the sheep.

10:14. I am the good shepherd: and I know mine, and mine know me.

10:15. As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for my sheep.

10:16. And other sheep I have that are not of this fold: them also I must bring. And they shall hear my voice: And there shall be one fold and one shepherd.

10:17. Therefore doth the Father love me: because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.

10:18. No man taketh it away from me: but I lay it down of myself.  And I have power to lay it down: and I have power to take it up again. This commandment have I received of my Father.

10:19. A dissension rose again among the Jews for these words.

10:20. And many of them said: He hath a devil and is mad. Why hear you him?

10:21. Others said: These are not the words of one that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?

10:22. And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: and it was winter.

10:23. And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon's porch.

10:24. The Jews therefore came round about him and said to him: How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.

10:25. Jesus answered them: I speak to you, and you believe not: the works that I do in the name of my Father, they give testimony of me.

10:26. But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.

10:27. My sheep hear my voice. And I know them: and they follow me.

10:28. And I give them life everlasting: and they shall not perish for ever. And no man shall pluck them out of my hand.

10:29. That which my Father hath given me is greater than all: and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my Father.

10:30. I and the Father are one.

10:31. The Jews then took up stones to stone him.

10:32. Jesus answered them: Many good works I have shewed you from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?

10:33. The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy: and because that thou being a, man, makest thyself God.

10:34. Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law: I said, you are gods?

10:35. If he called them gods to whom the word of God was spoken; and the scripture cannot be broken:

10:36. Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world: Thou blasphemest; because I said: I am the Son of God?

10:37. If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.

10:38. But if I do, though you will not believe me, believe the works: that you may know and believe that the Father is in me and I in the Father.

10:39. They sought therefore to take him: and he escaped out of their hands.

10:40. And he went again beyond the Jordan, into that place where John was baptizing first. And there he abode.

10:41. And many resorted to him: and they said: John indeed did no sign.

10:42. But all things whatsoever John said of this man were true.  And many believed n him.
