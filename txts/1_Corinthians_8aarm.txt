1 Corinthians Chapter 8

Though an idol be nothing, yet things offered up to idols are not to be eaten, for fear of scandal.

8:1. Now concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols: we know we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up: but charity edifieth.

8:2. And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet known as he ought to know.

8:3. But if any man love God, the same is known by him.

8:4. But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one.

8:5. For although there be that are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (for there be gods many and lords many):

8:6. Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him: and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.

8:7. But there is not knowledge in every one. For some until this present, with conscience of the idol, eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol: and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.

8:8. But meat doth not commend us to God. For neither, if we eat, shall we have the more: nor, if we eat not, shall we have the less.

8:9. But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak.

8:10. For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols?

8:11. And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ hath died?

8:12. Now when you sin thus against the brethren and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.

8:13. Wherefore, if meat scandalize my brother, I will never eat flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother.
