Ecclesiasticus Chapter 31

Of the desire of riches, and of moderation in eating and drinking.

31:1. Watching for riches consumeth the flesh, and the thought thereof driveth away sleep.

31:2. The thinking beforehand turneth away the understanding, and a grievous sickness maketh the soul sober.

31:3. The rich man hath laboured in gathering riches together, and when he resteth he shall be filled with his goods.

31:4. The poor man hath laboured in his low way of life, and in the end he is still poor.

31:5. He that loveth gold, shall not be justified: and he that followeth after corruption, shall be filled with it.

31:6. Many have been brought to fall for gold, and the beauty thereof hath been their ruin.

31:7. Gold is a stumblingblock to them that sacrifice to it: woe to them that eagerly follow after it, and every fool shall perish by it.

31:8. Blessed is the rich man that is found without blemish: and that hath not gone after gold, nor put his trust in money nor in treasures.

31:9. Who is he, and we will praise him? for he hath done wonderful things in his life.

31:10. Who hath been tried thereby, and made perfect, he shall have glory everlasting. He that could have transgressed, and hath not transgressed: and could do evil things, and hath not done them:

31:11. Therefore are his goods established in the Lord, and all the church of the saints shall declare his alms.

31:12. Art thou set at a great table? be not the first to open thy mouth upon it.

31:13. Say not: There are many things which are upon it.

31:14. Remember that a wicked eye is evil.

31:15. What is created more wicked than an eye? therefore shall it weep over all the face when it shall see.

31:16. Stretch not out thy hand first, lest being disgraced with envy thou be put to confusion.

31:17. Be not hasty in a feast.

31:18. Judge of the disposition of thy neighbour by thyself.

31:19. Use as a frugal man the things that are set before thee: lest if thou eatest much, thou be hated.

31:20. Leave off first, for manners' sake: and exceed not, lest thou offend.

31:21. And if thou sittest among many, reach not thy hand out first of all, and be not the first to ask for drink.

31:22. How sufficient is a little wine for a man well taught, and in sleeping thou shalt not be uneasy with it, and thou shalt feel no pain.

31:23. Watching, and choler, and gripes, are with an intemperate man:

31:24. Sound and wholesome sleep with a moderate man: he shall sleep till morning, and his soul shall be delighted with him.

31:25. And if thou hast been forced to eat much, arise, go out, and vomit: and it shall refresh thee, and thou shalt not bring sickness upon thy body.

31:26. Hear me, my son, and despise me not: and in the end thou shalt find my words.

31:27. In all thy works be quick, and no infirmity shall come to thee.

31:28. The lips of many shall bless him that is liberal of his bread, and the testimony of his truth is faithful.

31:29. Against him that is niggardly of his bread, the city will murmur, and the testimony of his niggardliness is true.

31:30. Challenge not them that love wine: for wine hath destroyed very many.

31:31. Fire trieth hard iron: so wine drunk to excess shall rebuke the hearts of the proud.

31:32. Wine taken with sobriety is equal life to men: if thou drink it moderately, thou shalt be sober.

31:33. What is his life, who is diminished with wine?

31:34. What taketh away life? death.

31:35. Wine was created from the beginning to make men joyful, and not to make them drunk.

31:36. Wine drunken with moderation is the joy of the soul and the heart.

31:37. Sober drinking is health to soul and body.

31:38. Wine drunken with excess raiseth quarrels, and wrath, and many ruins.

31:40. The heat of drunkenness is the stumblingblock of the fool, lessening strength and causing wounds.

31:41. Rebuke not thy neighbour in a banquet of wine: and despise him not in his mirth.

31:42. Speak not to him words of reproach: and press him not in demanding again.
