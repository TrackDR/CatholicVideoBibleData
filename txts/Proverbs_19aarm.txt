Proverbs Chapter 19

19:1. Better is the poor man, that walketh in his simplicity, than a rich man that is perverse in his lips and unwise.

19:2. Where there is no knowledge of the soul, there is no good: and he that is hasty with his feet shall stumble.

19:3. The folly of a man supplanteth his steps: and he fretteth in his mind against God.

19:4. Riches make many friends: but from the poor man, even they whom he had, depart.

19:5. A false witness shall not be unpunished: and he that speaketh lies, shall not escape.

19:6. Many honour the person of him that is mighty, and are friends of him that giveth gifts.

19:7. The brethren of the poor man hate him: moreover also his friends have departed far from him.  He that followeth after words only, shall have nothing.

19:8. But he that possesseth a mind, loveth his own soul, and he that keepeth prudence, shall find good things.

19:9. A false witness shall not be unpunished: and he that speaketh lies, shall perish.

19:10. Delicacies are not seemly for a fool: nor for a servant to have rule over princes.

19:11. The learning of a man is known by patience: and his glory is to pass over wrongs.

19:12. As the roaring of a lion, so also is the anger of a king: and his cheerfulness as the dew upon the grass.

19:13. A foolish son is the grief of his father: and a wrangling wife is like a roof continually dropping through.

19:14. House and riches are given by parents: but a prudent wife is properly from the Lord.

19:15. Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep, and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.

19:16. He that keepeth the commandment, keepeth his own soul: but he that neglecteth his own way, shall die.

19:17. He that hath mercy on the poor, lendeth to the Lord: and he will repay him.

19:18. Chastise thy son, despair not: but to the killing of him set not thy soul.

19:19. He that is impatient, shall suffer damage: and when he shall take away, he shall add another thing.

19:20. Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayst be wise in thy latter end.

19:21. There are many thoughts in the heart of a man: but the will of the Lord shall stand firm.

19:22. A needy man is merciful: and better is the poor than the lying man.

19:23. The fear of the Lord is unto life: and he shall abide in the fulness without being visited with evil.

19:24. The slothful hideth his hand under his armpit, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth.

19:25. The wicked man being scourged, the fool shall be wiser: but if thou rebuke a wise man, he will understand discipline.

19:26. He that afflicteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is infamous and unhappy.

19:27. Cease not, O my son, to hear instruction, and be not ignorant of the words of knowledge.

19:28. An unjust witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.

19:29. Judgments are prepared for scorners: and striking hammers for the bodies of fools.
