Proverbs Chapter 23

23:1. When thou shalt sit to eat with a prince, consider diligently what is set before thy face:

23:2. And put a knife to thy throat, if it be so that thou have thy soul in thy own power.

23:3. Be not desirous of his meats, in which is the bread of deceit.

23:4. Labour not to be rich: but set bounds to thy prudence.

23:5. Lift not up thy eyes to riches which thou canst not have: because they shall make themselves wings like those of an eagle, and shall fly towards heaven.

23:6. Eat not with an envious man, and desire not his meats:

23:7. Because, like a soothsayer, and diviner, he thinketh that which he knoweth not. Eat and drink, will he say to thee: and his mind is not with thee.

23:8. The meats which thou hadst eaten, thou shalt vomit up: and shalt lose thy beantiful words.

23:9. Speak not in the ears of fools: because they will despise the instruction of thy speech.

23:10. Touch not the bounds of little ones: and enter not into the field of the fatherless:

23:11. For their near kinsman is strong: and he will judge their cause against thee.

23:12. Let thy heart apply itself to instruction and thy ears to words of knowledge.

23:13. Withhold not correction from a child: for if thou strike him with the rod, he shall not die.

23:14. Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and deliver his soul from hell.

23:15. My son, if thy mind be wise, my heart shall rejoice with thee:

23:16. And my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips shall speak what is right.

23:17. Let not thy heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long:

23:18. Because thou shalt have hope in the latter end, and thy expectation shall not be taken away.

23:19. Hear thou, my son, and be wise: and guide thy mind in the way.

23:20. Be not in the feasts of great drinkers, nor in their revellings, who contribute flesh to eat:

23:21. Because they that give themselves to drinking, and that club together, shall be consumed: and drowsiness shall be clothed with rags.

23:22. Hearken to thy father, that begot thee: and despise not thy mother when she is old.

23:23. Buy truth, and do not sell wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.

23:24. The father of the just rejoiceth greatly: he that hath begotten a wise son, shall have joy in him.

23:25. Let thy father and thy mother be joyful, and let her rejoice that bore thee.

23:26. My son, give me thy heart: and let thy eyes keep my ways.

23:27. For a harlot is a deep ditch: and a strange woman is a narrow pit.

23:28. She lieth in wait in the way as a robber, and him whom she shall see unwary, she will kill.

23:29. Who hath woe? whose father hath woe? who hath contentions? who falls into pits? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?

23:30. Surely they that pass their time in wine, and study to drink off their cups.

23:31. Look not upon the wine when it is yellow, when the colour thereof shineth in the glass: it goeth in pleasantly,

23:32. But in the end, it will bite like a snake, and will spread abroad poison like a basilisk.

23:33. Thy eyes shall behold strange women, and thy heart shall utter perverse things.

23:34. And thou shalt be as one sleeping in the midst of the sea, and as a pilot fast asleep when the stern is lost.

23:35. And thou shalt say: They have beaten me, but I was not sensible of pain: they drew me, and I felt not: when shall I awake and find wine again?
