Job Chapter 23

Job wishes to be tried at God's tribunal.

23:1. Then Job answered, and said:

23:2. Now also my words are in bitterness, and the hand of my scourge is more grievous than my mourning.

23:3. Who will grant me that I might know and find him, and come even to his throne?

23:4. I would set judgment before him, and would fill my mouth with complaints.

23:5. That I might know the words that he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.

23:6. I would not that he should contend with me with much strength, nor overwhelm me with the weight of his greatness.

23:7. Let him propose equity against me, and let my judgment come to victory.

23:8. But if I go to the east, he appeareth not; if to the west, I shall not understand him.

23:9. If to the left hand, what shall I do? I shall not take hold on him: if I turn myself to the right hand, I shall not see him.

23:10. But he knoweth my way, and has tried me as gold that passeth through the fire:

23:11. My foot hath followed his steps, I have kept his way, and have not declined from it.

23:12. I have not departed from the commandments of his lips, and the words of his mouth I have hid in my bosom.

23:13. For he is alone, and no man can turn away his thought: and whatsoever his soul hath desired, that hath he done.

23:14. And when he shall have fulfilled his will in me, many other like things are also at hand with him.

23:15. And therefore I am troubled at his presence, and when I consider him I am made pensive with fear.

23:16. God hath softened my heart, and the Almighty hath troubled me.

23:17. For I have not perished because of the darkness that hangs over me, neither hath the mist covered my face.
