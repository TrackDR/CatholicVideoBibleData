Titus Chapter 2

How he is to instruct both old and young. The duty of servants.  The Christian's rule of life.

2:1. But speak thou the things that become sound doctrine:

2:2. That the aged men be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in love, in patience.

2:3. The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well:

2:4. That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love their husbands, to love their children.

2:5. To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the house, gentle, obedient to their husbands: that the word of God be not blasphemed.

2:6. Young men, in like manner, exhort that they be sober.

2:7. In all things shew thyself an example of good works, in doctrine, in integrity, in gravity,

2:8. The sound word that can not be blamed: that he who is on the contrary part may be afraid, having no evil to say of us.

2:9. Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters: in all things pleasing, not gainsaying:

2:10. Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

2:11. For the grace of God our Saviour hath appeared to all men:

2:12. Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly and justly and godly in this world,

2:13. Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.

2:14. Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good works.

2:15. These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority.  Let no man despise thee.
