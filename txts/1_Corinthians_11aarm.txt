1 Corinthians Chapter 11

Women must have a covering over their heads. He blameth the abuses of their love feasts and upon that occasion treats of the Blessed Sacrament.

11:1. Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.

11:2. Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you.

11:3. But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ: and the head of the woman is the man: and the head of Christ is God.

11:4. Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraceth his head.

11:5. But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven.

11:6. For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head.

11:7. The man indeed ought not to cover his head: because he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man.

11:8. For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.

11:9. For the man was not created for the woman: but the woman for the man.

11:10. Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels.

11:11. But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.

11:12. For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God.

11:13. You yourselves judge. Doth it become a woman to pray unto God uncovered?

11:14. Doth not even nature itself teach you that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him?

11:15. But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.

11:16. But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the Church of God.

11:17. Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together, not for the better, but for the worse.

11:18. For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you. And in part I believe it.

11:19. For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved may be made manifest among you.

11:20. When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the Lord's supper.

11:21. For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.

11:22. What, have you no houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not.

11:23. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread,

11:24. And giving thanks, broke and said: Take ye and eat: This is my body, which shall be delivered for you. This do for the commemoration of me.

11:25. In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood. This do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.

11:26. For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.

11:27. Therefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.

11:28. But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread and drink of the chalice.

11:29. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.

11:30. Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you: and many sleep.

11:31. But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.

11:32. But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.

11:33. Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.

11:34. If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come.
