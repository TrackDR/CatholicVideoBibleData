Amos Chapter 5

A lamentation for Israel: an exhortation to return to God.

5:1. Hear ye this word, which I take up concerning you for a lamentation. The house of Israel is fallen, and it shall rise no more.

5:2. The virgin of Israel is cast down upon her land, there is none to raise her up.

5:3. For thus saith the Lord God: The city, out of which came forth a thousand, there shall be left in it a hundred: and out of which there came a hundred, there shall be left in it ten, in the house of Israel.

5:4. For thus saith the Lord to the house of Israel: Seek ye me, and you shall live.

5:5. But seek not Bethel, and go not into Galgal, neither shall you pass over to Bersabee: for Galgal shall go into captivity, and Bethel shall be unprofitable.

5:6. Seek ye the Lord, and live: lest the house of Joseph be burnt with fire, and it shall devour, and there shall be none to quench Bethel.

5:7. You that turn judgment into wormwood, and forsake justice in the land,

5:8. Seek him that maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and that turneth darkness into morning, and that changeth day into night: that calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The Lord is his name.

5:9. He that with a smile bringeth destruction upon the strong, and waste upon the mighty.

5:10. They have hated him that rebuketh in the gate: and have abhorred him that speaketh perfectly.

5:11. Therefore because you robbed the poor, and took the choice prey from him: you shall build houses with square stone, and shall not dwell in them: you shall plant most delightful vineyards, and shall not drink the wine of them.

5:12. Because I know your manifold crimes, and your grievous sins: enemies of the just, taking bribes, and oppressing the poor in the gate.

5:13. Therefore the prudent shall keep silence at that time, for it is an evil time.

5:14. Seek ye good, and not evil, that you may live: and the Lord the God of hosts will be with you, as you have said.

5:15. Hate evil, and love good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be the Lord the God of hosts may have mercy on the remnant of Joseph.

5:16. Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of hosts the sovereign Lord: In every street there shall be wailing: and in all places that are without, they shall say: Alas, alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to lament.

5:17. And in all vineyards there shall be wailing: because I will pass through in the midst of thee, saith the Lord.

5:18. Woe to them that desire the day of the Lord: to what end is it for you? the day of the Lord is darkness, and not light.

5:19. As if a man should flee from the face of a lion, and a bear should meet him: or enter into the house, and lean with his hand upon the wall, and a serpent should bite him.

5:20. Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light: and obscurity, and no brightness in it?

5:21. I hate, and have rejected your festivities: and I will not receive the odour of your assemblies.

5:22. And if you offer me holocausts, and your gifts, I will not receive them: neither will I regard the vows of your fat beasts.

5:23. Take away from me the tumult of thy songs: and I will not hear the canticles of thy harp.

5:24. But judgment shall be revealed as water, and justice as a mighty torrent.

5:25. Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me in the desert for forty years, O house of Israel?

5:26. But you carried a tabernacle for your Moloch, and the image of your idols, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.

5:27. And I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, the God of hosts is his name.
