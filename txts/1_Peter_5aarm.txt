1 Peter Chapter 5

He exhorts both priests and laity to their respective duties and recommends to all humility and watchfulness.

5:1. The ancients therefore that are among you, I beseech who am myself also an ancient and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as also a partaker of that glory which is to be revealed in time to come:

5:2. Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking care of it, not by constraint but willingly, according to God: not for filthy lucre's sake but voluntarily:

5:3. Neither as lording it over the clergy but being made a pattern of the flock from the heart.

5:4. And when the prince of pastors shall appear, you shall receive a never fading crown of glory.

5:5. In like manner, ye young men, be subject to the ancients. And do you all insinuate humility one to another: for God resisteth the proud, but to the humble he giveth grace.

5:6. Be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in the time of visitation:

5:7. Casting all your care upon him, for he hath care of you.

5:8. Be sober and watch: because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour.

5:9. Whom resist ye, strong in faith: knowing that the same affliction befalls, your brethren who are in the world.

5:10. But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little, will himself perfect you and confirm you and establish you.

5:11. To him be glory and empire, for ever and ever. Amen.

5:12. By Sylvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I think, I have written briefly: beseeching and testifying that this is the true grace of God, wherein you stand.

5:13. The church that is in Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you. And so doth my son, Mark.

5:14. Salute one another with a holy kiss. Grace be to all you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
