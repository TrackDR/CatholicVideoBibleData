Job Chapter 31

Job, to defend himself from the unjust judgments of his friends, gives a sincere account of his own virtues.

31:1. I made a covenant with my eyes, that I would not so much as think upon a virgin.

31:2. For what part should God from above have in me, and what inheritance the Almighty from on high?

31:3. Is not destruction to the wicked, and aversion to them that work iniquity?

31:4. Doth not he consider my ways, and number all my steps?

31:5. If I have walked in vanity, and my foot hath made haste to deceit:

31:6. Let him weigh me in a just balance, and let God know my simplicity.

31:7. If my step hath turned out of the way, and if my heart hath followed my eyes, and if a spot hath cleaved to my hands:

31:8. Then let me sow and let another reap: and let my offspring be rooted out.

31:9. If my heart hath been deceived upon a woman, and if I have laid wait at my friend's door:

31:10. Let my wife be the harlot of another, and let other men lie with her.

31:11. For this is a heinous crime, and a most grievous iniquity.

31:12. It is a fire that devoureth even to destruction, and rooteth up all things that spring.

31:13. If I have despised to abide judgment with my manservant, or my maidservant, when they had any controversy against me:

31:14. For what shall I do when God shall rise to judge? and when he shall examine, what shall I answer him?

31:15. Did not he that made me in the womb make him also: and did not one and the same form me in the womb?

31:16. If I have denied to the poor what they desired, and have made the eyes of the widow wait:

31:17. If I have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof:

31:18. (For from my infancy mercy grew up with me: and it came out with me from my mother's womb:)

31:19. If I have despised him that was perishing for want of clothing, and the poor man that had no covering:

31:20. If his sides have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep:

31:21. If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, even when I saw myself superior in the gate:

31:22. Let my shoulder fall from its joint, and let my arm with its bones be broken.

31:23. For I have always feared God as waves swelling over me, and his weight I was unable to bear.

31:24. If I have thought gold my strength, and have said to fine gold: My confidence:

31:25. If I have rejoiced over my great riches, and because my hand had gotten much.

31:26. If I beheld the sun when it shined and the moon going in brightness:

31:27. And my heart in secret hath rejoiced, and I have kissed my hand with, my mouth:

31:28. Which is a very great iniquity, and a denial against the most high God.

31:29. If I have been glad at the downfall of him that hated me, and have rejoiced that evil had found him.

31:30. For I have not given my mouth to sin, by wishing a curse to his soul.

31:31. If the men of my tabernacle have not said: Who will give us of his flesh that we may be filled?

31:32. The stranger did not stay without, my door was open to the traveller.

31:33. If as a man I have hid my sin, and have concealed my iniquity in my bosom.

31:34. If I have been afraid at a very great multitude, and the contempt of kinsmen hath terrified me: and have not rather held my peace, and not gone out of the door.

31:35. Who would grant me a hearing, that the Almighty may hear my desire: and that he himself that judgeth would write a book,

31:36. That I may carry it on my shoulder, and put it about me as a crown?

31:37. At every step of mine I would pronounce it, and offer it as to a prince.

31:38. If my land cry against me, and with it the furrows thereof mourn:

31:39. If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, and have afflicted the son of the tillers thereof:

31:40. Let thistles grow up to me instead of wheat, and thorns instead of barley.
