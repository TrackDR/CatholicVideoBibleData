Job Chapter 38

God interposes and shews from the things he hath made, that man cannot comprehend his power and wisdom.

38:1. Then the Lord answered Job out of a whirlwind, and said:

38:2. Who is this that wrappeth up sentences in unskilful words?

38:3. Gird up thy loins like a man: I will ask thee, and answer thou me.

38:4. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?  tell me if thou hast understanding.

38:5. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it?

38:6. Upon what are its bases grounded? or who laid the corner stone thereof,

38:7. When the morning stars praised me together, and all the sons of God made a joyful melody?

38:8. Who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth as issuing out of the womb:

38:9. When I made a cloud the garment thereof, and wrapped it in a mist as in swaddling bands?

38:10. I set my bounds around it, and made it bars and doors:

38:11. And I said: Hitherto thou shalt come, and shalt go no further, and here thou shalt break thy swelling waves.

38:12. Didst thou since thy birth command the morning, and shew the dawning of the day its place?

38:13. And didst thou hold the extremities of the earth shaking them, and hast thou shaken the ungodly out of it?

38:14. The seal shall be restored as clay, and shall stand as a garment.

38:15. From the wicked their light shall be taken away, and the high arm shall be broken.

38:16. Hast thou entered into the depths of the sea, and walked in the lowest parts of the deep?

38:17. Have the gates of death been opened to thee, and hast thou seen the darksome doors?

38:18. Hast thou considered the breadth of the earth? tell me, if thou knowest all things?

38:19. Where is the way where light dwelleth, and where is the place of darkness?

38:20. That thou mayst bring every thing to its own bounds, and understand the paths of the house thereof.

38:21. Didst thou know then that thou shouldst be born? and didst thou know the number of thy days?

38:22. Hast thou entered into the storehouses of the snow, or hast thou beheld the treasures of the hail:

38:23. Which I have prepared for the time of the enemy, against the day of battle and war?

38:24. By what way is the light spread, and heat divided upon the earth?

38:25. Who gave a course to violent showers, or a way for noisy thunder:

38:26. That it should rain on the earth without man in the wilderness, where no mortal dwelleth:

38:27. That it should fill the desert and desolate land, and should bring forth green grass?

38:28. Who is the father of rain? or who begot the drops of dew?

38:29. Out of whose womb came the ice? and the frost from heaven who hath gendered it?

38:30. The waters are hardened like a stone, and the surface of the deep is congealed.

38:31. Shalt thou be able to join together the shining stars the Pleiades, or canst thou stop the turning about of Arcturus?

38:32. Canst thou bring forth the day star in its time, and make the evening star to rise upon the children of the earth?

38:33. Dost thou know the order of heaven, and canst thou set down the reason thereof on the earth?

38:34. Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that an abundance of waters may cover thee?

38:35. Canst thou send lightnings, and will they go, and will they return and say to thee: Here we are?

38:36. Who hath put wisdom in the heart of man? or who gave the cock understanding?

38:37. Who can declare the order of the heavens, or who can make the harmony of heaven to sleep?

38:38. When was the dust poured on the earth, and the clods fastened together?

38:39. Wilt thou take the prey for the lioness, and satisfy the appetite of her whelps,

38:40. When they couch in the dens and lie in wait in holes?

38:41. Who provideth food for the raven, when her young ones cry to God, wandering about, because they have no meat?
