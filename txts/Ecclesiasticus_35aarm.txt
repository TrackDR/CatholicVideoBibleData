Ecclesiasticus Chapter 35

What sacrifices are pleasing to God.

35:1. He that keepeth the law, multiplieth offerings.

35:2. It is a wholesome sacrifice to take heed to the commandments, and to depart from all iniquity.

35:3. And to depart from injustice, is to offer a propitiatory sacrifice for injustices, and a begging of pardon for sins.

35:4. He shall return thanks, that offereth fine flour: and he that doth mercy, offereth sacrifice.

35:5. To depart from iniquity is that which pleaseth the Lord, and to depart from injustice, is an entreaty for sins.

35:6. Thou shalt not appear empty in the sight of the Lord.

35:7. For all these things are to be done because of the commandment of God.

35:8. The oblation of the just maketh the altar fat, and is an odour of sweetness in the sight of the most High.

35:9. The sacrifice of the just is acceptable, and the Lord will not forget the memorial thereof.

35:10. Give glory to God with a good heart: and diminish not the firstfruits of thy hands.

35:11. In every gift shew a cheerful countenance, and sanctify thy tithes with joy.

35:12. Give to the most High according to what he hath given to thee, and with a good eye do according to the ability of thy hands:

35:13. For the Lord maketh recompense, and will give thee seven times as much.

35:14. Do not offer wicked gifts, for such he will not receive.

35:15. And look not upon an unjust sacrifice, for the Lord is judge, and there is not with him respect of person.

35:16. The Lord will not accept any person against a poor man, and he will hear the prayer of him that is wronged.

35:17. He will not despise the prayers of the fatherless: nor the widow, when she poureth out her complaint.

35:18. Do not the widow's tears run down the cheek, and her cry against him that causeth them to fall?

35:19. For from the cheek they go up even to heaven, and the Lord that heareth will not be delighted with them.

35:20. He that adoreth God with joy, shall be accepted, and his prayer shall approach even to the clouds.

35:21. The prayer of him that humbleth himself, shall pierce the clouds: and till it come nigh he will not be comforted: and he will not depart till the most High behold.

35:22. And the Lord will not be slack, but will judge for the just, and will do judgment: and the Almighty will not have patience with them, that he may crush their back:

35:23. And he will repay vengeance to the Gentiles, till he have taken away the multitude of the proud, and broken the sceptres of the unjust,

35:24. Till he have rendered to men according to their deeds: and according to the works of Adam, and according to his presumption,

35:25. Till he have judged the cause of his people, and he shall delight the just with his mercy.

35:26. The mercy of God is beautiful in the time of affliction, as a cloud of rain in the time of drought.
