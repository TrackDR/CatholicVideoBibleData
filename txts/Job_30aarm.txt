Job Chapter 30

Job shews the wonderful change of his temporal estate, from welfare to great calamity.

30:1. But now the younger in time scorn me, whose fathers I would not have set with the dogs of my flock:

30:2. The strength of whose hands was to me as nothing, and they were thought unworthy of life itself.

30:3. Barren with want and hunger, who gnawed in the wilderness, disfigured with calamity and misery.

30:4. And they ate grass, and barks of trees, and the root of junipers was their food.

30:5. Who snatched up these things out of the valleys, and when they had found any of them, they ran to them with a cry.

30:6. They dwelt in the desert places of torrents, and in caves of earth, or upon the gravel.

30:7. They pleased themselves among these kind of things, and counted it delightful to be under the briers.

30:8. The children of foolish and base men, and not appearing at all upon the earth.

30:9. Now I am turned into their song, and am become their byword.

30:10. They abhor me, and flee far from me, and are not afraid to spit in my face.

30:11. For he hath opened his quiver, and hath afflicted me, and hath put a bridle into my mouth.

30:12. At the right hand of my rising, my calamities forthwith arose: they have overthrown my feet, and have overwhelmed me with their paths as with waves.

30:13. They have destroyed my ways, they have lain in wait against me, and they have prevailed, and there was none to help.

30:14. They have rushed in upon me, as when a wall is broken, and a gate opened, and have rolled themselves down to my miseries.

30:15. I am brought to nothing: as a wind thou hast taken away my desire: and my prosperity hath passed away like a cloud.

30:16. And now my soul fadeth within myself, and the days of affliction possess me.

30:17. In the night my bone is pierced with sorrows: and they that feed upon me, do not sleep.

30:18. With the multitude of them my garment is consumed, and they have girded me about, as with the collar of my coat.

30:19. I am compared to dirt, and am likened to embers and ashes.

30:20. I cry to thee, and thou hearest me not: I stand up, and thou dost not regard me.

30:21. Thou art changed to be cruel toward me, and in the hardness of thy hand thou art against me.

30:22. Thou hast lifted me up, and set me as it were upon the wind, and thou hast mightily dashed me.

30:23. I know that thou wilt deliver me to death, where a house is appointed for every one that liveth.

30:24. But yet thou stretchest not forth thy hand to their consumption: and if they shall fall down thou wilt save.

30:25. I wept heretofore for him that was afflicted, and my soul had compassion on the poor.

30:26. I expected good things, and evils are come upon me: I waited for light, and darkness broke out.

30:27. My inner parts have boiled without any rest, the days of affliction have prevented me.

30:28. I went mourning without indignation; I rose up, and cried in the crowd.

30:29. I was the brother of dragons, and companion of ostriches.

30:30. My skin is become black upon me, and my bones are dried up with heat.

30:31. My harp is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of those that weep.
