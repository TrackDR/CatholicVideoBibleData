Proverbs Chapter 28

28:1. The wicked man fleeth, when no man pursueth: but the just, bold as a lion, shall be without dread.

28:2. For the sins of the land many are the princes thereof: and for the wisdom of a man, and the knowledge of those things that are said, the life of the prince shall be prolonged.

28:3. A poor man that oppresseth the poor, is like a violent shower, which bringeth a famine.

28:4. They that forsake the law, praise the wicked man: they that keep it, are incensed against him.

28:5. Evil men think not on judgment: but they that seek after the Lord, take notice of all things.

28:6. Better is the poor man walking in his simplicity, than the rich in crooked ways.

28:7. He that keepeth the law, is a wise son: but he that feedeth gluttons, shameth his father.

28:8. He that heapeth together riches by usury and loan, gathereth them for him that will be bountiful to the poor.

28:9. He that turneth away his ears from hearing the law, his prayer shall be an abomination.

28:10. He that deceiveth the just in a wicked way, shall fall in his own destruction: and the upright shall possess his goods.

28:11. The rich man seemeth to himself wise: but the poor man that is prudent shall search him out.

28:12. In the joy of the just there is great glory: when the wicked reign, men are ruined.

28:13. He that hideth his sins, shall not prosper: but he that shall confess, and forsake them, shall obtain mercy.

28:14. Blessed is the man that is always fearful: but he that is hardened in mind shall fall into evil.

28:15. As a roaring lion, and a hungry bear, so is a wicked prince over the poor people.

28:16. A prince void of prudence shall oppress many by calumny: but he that hateth covetousness, shall prolong his days.

28:17. A man that doth violence to the blood of a person, if he flee even to the pit, no man will stay him.

28:18. He that walketh uprightly, shall be saved: he that is perverse in his ways, shall fall at once.

28:19. He that tilleth his ground, shall be filled with bread: but he that followeth idleness, shall be filled with poverty.

28:20. A faithful man shall be much praised: but he that maketh haste to be rich, shall not be innocent.

28:21. He that hath respect to a person in judgment, doth not well: such a man even for a morsel of bread forsaketh the truth.

28:22. A man that maketh haste to be rich, and envieth others, is ignorant that poverty shall come upon him.

28:23. He that rebuketh a man, shall afterward find favour with him, more than he that by a flattering tongue deceiveth him.

28:24. He that stealeth any thing from his father, or from his mother: and saith, This is no sin, is the partner of a murderer.

28:26. He that boasteth and puffeth up himself, stirreth up quarrels: but he that trusteth in the Lord, shall be healed.

28:26. He that trusteth in his own heart, is a fool: but he that walketh wisely, he shall be saved.

28:27. He that giveth to the poor shall not want: he that despiseth his intreaty, shall suffer indigence.

28:28. When the wicked rise up, men shall hide themselves: when they perish, the just shall be multiplied.
