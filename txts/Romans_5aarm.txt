Romans Chapter 5

The grounds we have for hope in Christ. Sin and death came by Adam, grace and life by Christ.

5:1. Being justified therefore by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:

5:2. By whom also we have access through faith into this grace wherein we stand: and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God.

5:3. And not only so: but we glory also in tribulation, knowing that tribulation worketh patience;

5:4. And patience trial; and trial hope;

5:5. And hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.

5:6. For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly?

5:7. For scarce for a just man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to die.

5:8. But God commendeth his charity towards us: because when as yet we were sinners according to the time.

5:9. Christ died for us. Much more therefore, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.

5:10. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son: much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.

5:11. And not only so: but also we glory in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.

5:12. Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.

5:13. For until the law sin was in the world: but sin was not imputed, when the law was not.

5:14. But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them also who have not sinned, after the similitude of the transgression of Adam, who is a figure of him who was to come.

5:15. But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the offence of one, many died: much more the grace of God and the gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.

5:16. And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation: but grace is of many offences unto justification.

5:17. For if by one man's offence death reigned through one; much more they who receive abundance of grace and of the gift and of justice shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.

5:18. Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation: so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life.

5:19. For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners: so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just.

5:20. Now the law entered in that sin might abound. And where sin abounded, grace did more abound.

5:21. That as sin hath reigned to death: so also grace might reign by justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
