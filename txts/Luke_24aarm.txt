Luke Chapter 24

Christ's resurrection and manifestation of himself to his disciples.

24:1. And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared.

24:2. And they found the stone rolled back from the sepulchre.

24:3. And going in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

24:4. And it came to pass, as they were astonished in their mind at this, behold, two men stood by them, in shining apparel.

24:5. And as they were afraid and bowed down their countenance towards the ground, they said unto them: Why seek you the living with the dead?

24:6. He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke unto you, when he was yet in Galilee,

24:7. Saying: The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again.

24:8. And they remembered his words.

24:9. And going back from the sepulchre, they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.

24:10. And it was Mary Magdalen and Joanna and Mary of James and the other women that were with them, who told these things to the apostles.

24:11. And these words seemed to them as idle tales: and they did not believe them.

24:12. But Peter rising up, ran to the sepulchre and, stooping down, he saw the linen cloths laid by themselves: and went away wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.

24:13. And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, named Emmaus.

24:14. And they talked together of all these things which had happened.

24:15. And it came to pass that while they talked and reasoned with themselves, Jesus himself also, drawing near, went with them.

24:16. But their eyes were held, that they should not know him.

24:17. And he said to them: What are these discourses that you hold one with another as you walk and are sad?

24:18. And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, said to him: Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things that have been done there in these days?

24:19. To whom he said: What things? And they said: Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in work and word before God and all the people.

24:20. And how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be condemned to death and crucified him.

24:21. But we hoped that it was he that should have redeemed Israel. And now besides all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done.

24:22. Yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us who, before it was light, were at the sepulchre,

24:23. And not finding his body, came, saying that they had all seen a vision of angels, who say that he is alive.

24:24. And some of our people went to the sepulchre and found it so as the women had said: but him they found not.

24:25. Then he said to them: O foolish and slow of heart to believe in all things, Which the prophets have spoken.

24:26. Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and so, to enter into his glory?

24:27. And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things that were concerning him.

24:28. And they drew nigh to the town whither they were going: and he made as though he would go farther.

24:29. But they constrained him, saying: Stay with us, because it is towards evening and the day is now far spent. And he went in with them.

24:30. And it came to pass, whilst he was at table with them, he took bread and blessed and brake and gave to them.

24:31. And their eyes were opened: and they knew him. And he vanished out of their sight.

24:32. And they said one to the other: Was not our heart burning within us, whilst he spoke in the way and opened to us the scriptures?

24:33. And rising up, the same hour, they went back to Jerusalem: and they found the eleven gathered together, and those that were with them,

24:34. Saying: The Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon.

24:35. And they told what things were done in the way: and how they knew him in the breaking of bread.

24:36. Now, whilst they were speaking these things, Jesus stood in the midst of them and saith to them: Peace be to you. It is I: Fear not.

24:37. But they being troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw a spirit.

24:38. And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?

24:39. See my hands and feet, that it is I myself. Handle, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me to have.

24:40. And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and feet.

24:41. But while they yet believed not and wondered for joy, he said: Have you here any thing to eat?

24:42. And they offered him a piece of a broiled fish and a honeycomb.

24:43. And when he had eaten before them, taking the remains, he gave to them.

24:44. And he said to them: These are the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the psalms, concerning me.

24:45. Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.

24:46. And he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise again from the dead, the third day:

24:47. And that penance and remission of sins should be preached in his name, unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

24:48. And you are witnesses of these things.

24:49. And I send the promise of my Father upon you: but stay you in the city till you be endued with power from on high.

24:50. And he led them out as far as Bethania: and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.

24:51. And it came to pass, whilst he blessed them, he departed from them and was carried up to heaven.

24:52. And they adoring went back into Jerusalem with great joy.

24:53. And they were always in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
