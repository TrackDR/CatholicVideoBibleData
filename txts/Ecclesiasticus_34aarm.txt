Ecclesiasticus Chapter 34

The vanity of dreams. The advantage of experience, and of the fear of God.

34:1. The hopes of a man that is void of understanding are vain and deceitful: and dreams lift up fools.

34:2. The man that giveth heed to lying visions, is like to him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind.

34:3. The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another: as when a man's likeness is before the face of a man.

34:4. What can be made clean by the unclean? and what truth can come from that which is false?

34:5. Deceitful divinations and lying omens and the dreams of evildoers, are vanity:

34:6. And the heart fancieth as that of a woman in travail: except it be a vision sent forth from the most High, set not thy heart upon them.

34:7. For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them.

34:8. The word of the law shall be fulfilled without a lie, and wisdom shall be made plain in the mouth of the faithful.

34:9. What doth he know, that hath not been tried? A man that hath much experience, shall think of many things: and he that hath learned many things, shall shew forth understanding.

34:10. He that hath no experience, knoweth little: and he that hath been experienced in many things, multiplieth prudence.

34:11. He that hath not been tried, what manner of things doth he know? he that hath been surprised, shall abound with subtlety.

34:12. I have seen many things by travelling, and many customs of things.

34:13. Sometimes I have been in danger of death for these things, and I have been delivered by the grace of God.

34:14. The spirit of those that fear God, is sought after, and by his regard shall be blessed.

34:15. For their hope is on him that saveth them, and the eyes of God are upon them that love him.

34:16. He that feareth the Lord shall tremble at nothing, and shall not be afraid: for he is his hope.

34:17. The soul of him that feareth the Lord is blessed.

34:18. To whom doth he look, and who is his strength?

34:19. The eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear him, he is their powerful protector, and strong stay, a defence from the heat, and a cover from the sun at noon,

34:20. A preservation from stumbling, and a help from falling: he raiseth up the soul, and enlighteneth the eyes, and giveth health, and life, and blessing.

34:21. The offering of him that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, is stained, and the mockeries of the unjust are not acceptable.

34:22. The Lord is only for them that wait upon him in the way of truth and justice.

34:23. The most High approveth not the gifts of the wicked: neither hath he respect to the oblations of the unjust, nor will he be pacified for sins by the multitude of their sacrifices.

34:24. He that offereth sacrifice of the goods of the poor, is as one that sacrificeth the son in the presence of his father.

34:25. The bread of the needy, is the life of the poor: he that defraudeth them thereof, is a man of blood.

34:26. He that taketh away the bread gotten by sweat, is like him that killeth his neighbour.

34:27. He that sheddeth blood, and he that defraudeth the laborer of his hire, are brothers.

34:28. When one buildeth up, and another pulleth down: what profit have they but the labour?

34:29. When one prayeth, and another curseth: whose voice will God hear?

34:30. He that washeth himself after touching the dead, if he toucheth him again, what doth his washing avail?

34:31. So a man that fasteth for his sins, and doth the same again, what doth his humbling himself profit him? who will hear his prayer?
