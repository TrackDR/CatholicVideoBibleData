Job Chapter 32

Eliu is angry with Job and his friends. He boasts of himself.

32:1. So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he seemed just to himself.

32:2. And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite of the kindred of Ram, was angry and was moved to indignation: now he was angry against Job, because he said he was just before God.

32:3. And he was angry with his friends, because they had not found a reasonable answer, but only had condemned Job.

32:4. So Eliu waited while Job was speaking because they were his elders that were speaking.

32:5. But when he saw that the three were not able to answer, he was exceedingly angry.

32:6. Then Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered, and said: I am younger in days, and you are more ancient, therefore hanging down my head, I was afraid to shew you my opinion.

32:7. For I hoped that greater age would speak, and that a multitude of years would teach wisdom.

32:8. But, as I see, there is a spirit in men, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding.

32:9. They that are aged are not the wise men, neither do the ancients understand judgment.

32:10. Therefore I will speak: Hearken to me, I also will shew you my wisdom.

32:11. For I have waited for your words, I have given ear to your wisdom, as long as you were disputing in words.

32:12. And as long as I thought you said some thing, I considered: but, as I see, there is none of you that can convince Job, and answer his words.

32:13. Lest you should say: We have found wisdom, God hath cast him down, not man.

32:14. He hath spoken nothing to me, and I will not answer him according to your words.

32:15. They were afraid, and answered no more, and they left off speaking.

32:16. Therefore because I have waited, and they have not spoken: they stood, and answered no more:

32:17. I also will answer my part, and will shew my knowledge.

32:18. For I am full of matter to speak of, and the spirit of my bowels straiteneth me.

32:19. Behold, my belly is as new wine which wanteth vent, which bursteth the new vessels.

32:20. I will speak and take breath a little: I will open my lips, and will answer.

32:21. I will not accept the person of man, and I will not level God with man.

32:22. For I know not how long I shall continue, and whether after a while my Maker may take me away.
