Job Chapter 29

Job relates his former happiness, and the respect that all men shewed him.

29:1. Job also added, taking up his parable, and said:

29:2. Who will grant me, that I might be according to the months past, according to the days in which God kept me?

29:3. When his lamp shined over my head, and I walked by his light in darkness?

29:4. As I was in the days of my youth, when God was secretly in my tabernacle?

29:5. When the Almighty was with me: and my servants round about me?

29:6. When I washed my feet with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil?

29:7. When I went out to the gate of the city, and in the street they prepared me a chair?

29:8. The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the old men rose up and stood.

29:9. The princes ceased to speak, and laid the finger on their mouth.

29:10. The rulers held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to their throat.

29:11. The ear that heard me blessed me, and the eye that saw me gave witness to me:

29:12. Because I had delivered the poor man that cried out; and the fatherless, that had no helper.

29:13. The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and I comforted the heart of the widow.

29:14. I was clad with justice: and I clothed myself with my judgment, as with a robe and a diadem.

29:15. I was an eye to the blind, and a foot to the lame.

29:16. I was the father of the poor: and the cause which I knew not, I searched out most diligently.

29:17. I broke the jaws of the wicked man, and out of his teeth I took away the prey.

29:18. And I said: I shall die in my nest, and as a palm tree shall multiply my days.

29:19. My root is opened beside the waters, and dew shall continue in my harvest.

29:20. My glory shall always be renewed, and my bow in my hand shall be repaired.

29:21. They that heard me, waited for my sentence, and being attentive held their peace at my counsel.

29:22. To my words they durst add nothing, and my speech dropped upon them.

29:23. They waited for me as for rain, and they opened their mouth as for a latter shower.

29:24. If at any time I laughed on them, they believed not, and the light of my countenance fell not on earth.

29:25. If I had a mind to go to them, I sat first, and when I sat as a king, with his army standing about him, yet I was a comforter of them that mourned.
